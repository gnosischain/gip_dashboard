title: Should GnosisDAO fund p2panda's off-chain solution for secure group encryption?

  \n## Category\n\nFunding - Rewards\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nHello Gnosis community!\n\
  \nWe would like to realize a prototype for a decentralized, off-chain, encrypted\
  \ group chat where Ethereum addresses can serve as the receiver's identifiers.\n\
  \nTo achieve this we want to improve and build on top of the [Messaging Layer Security\
  \ Protocol](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks) (MLS) and the [p2panda](https://p2panda.org/)\
  \ protocol. This technology fills a need in the Gnosis community for a generic and\
  \ encrypted off-chain data layer.\n\nThis technology fills a need in the Gnosis\
  \ community for a generic and encrypted off-chain data layer. The group chat will\
  \ also be a proof of concept and template for future applications serving the Gnosis\
  \ community using the same infrastructure.\n\n## Specification\n\n[p2panda](https://p2panda.org/)\
  \ is a new protocol and ecosystem for building decentralised applications with authenticated\
  \ and encrypted data which is automatically stored and synced between computers.\n\
  \nSome of the building blocks of p2panda are a permission system, conflict-free\
  \ replicated data types, multi-key identities, data schemas, multi-writer documents,\
  \ local deletion, sparse replication, dynamic GraphQL queries, hybrid network topologies\
  \ and more.\n\nWhile p2panda aims at being a low-barrier framework to enter the\
  \ p2p space without worrying too much about the technical challenges coming with\
  \ it, we also want to offer a toolbox to build radical applications which work locally,\
  \ offline and both in the browser and on low-energy devices like a smartphone or\
  \ embedded computer.\n\nData is encrypted with the help of the MLS protocol providing\
  \ Double-Ratchet-based group encryption. MLS assures Post-Compromise Security (PCS)\
  \ and Forward Secrecy (FS) and still stays performant for large groups. While MLS\
  \ is capable of working in a decentralised environment it hasn't been explicitly\
  \ specified for it. With p2panda we have all the building blocks to realize MLS\
  \ in a fully decentralised setting.\n\nFor all of this to play nicely together,\
  \ the following implementation steps are planned:\n\n### Secret Groups\n\n_Secret\
  \ Groups_ is the data schema that p2panda uses to handle data encryption for groups\
  \ in a decentralised setting and it builds on MLS as its underlying layer.\n\np2panda\
  \ already contains a low-level API for MLS that we implemented as a precursor for\
  \ the more high-level _Secret Groups_. This low-level API supports two basic usage\
  \ scenarios: Double-Ratchet-based encryption (the MLS default) and a so called \"\
  Long Term Secret\" encryption on top of that. The latter allows group members to\
  \ still decrypt past data after entering the group, which is practical for building\
  \ applications like Wikis. Double-Ratchet-based encryption offers Forward Secrecy\
  \ instead (FS), which can be used for secure chat applications and other use cases\
  \ where new group members should not access past data.\n\nThe next step will be\
  \ building an elegant high-level API that makes this system easily accessible for\
  \ developers that want to integrate _Secret Groups_ in their applications. This\
  \ involves additions to our GraphQL API, p2panda's built-in data schemas and replication\
  \ data format, which are all part of our core protocol specification.\n\n**Further\

  - Draft \"Secret Group\" specification in p2panda: https://p2panda.org/specification/encryption\n\
  \n### Rust and TypeScript libraries\n\nDevelopers will use our Rust and TypeScript\
  \ libraries to integrate p2panda in their applications.\n\nTo persist MLS group\
  \ state we will implement interfaces for some known storage backends developers\
  \ can choose from (SQL, IndexedDB, LocalStorage). To account for forks of diverging\
  \ group state (due to network fragmentation) we need to extend our persistence system\
  \ with an additional layer. This layer keeps past group states for a while to be\
  \ able to decrypt messages from \"forked\" group states. This temporarily weakens\
  \ Forward Secrecy the more fragmented the group state gets.\n\n**Further Links**\n\

  \ package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/p2panda-js\n\n### Key Groups\n\nThe MLS\
  \ specification does not have a concept of \"moderators\" or \"administrators\"\
  \ in a group. Theoretically all members of the group can mutate its state. p2panda\
  \ _Key Groups_ are a permission layer on top of MLS which allows for decentralised\
  \ permission handling of multi-writer data. Next to permissions they also enable\
  \ multi-device identities.\n\nAs part of this effort we will create an implementation\
  \ of our specification of the _Key Groups_ system, which will be able to model a\
  \ permission system on top of any encrypted group.\n\n**Further Links**\n\n- Draft\
  \ \"Key Group\" specification: https://p2panda.org/specification/authorisation\n\
  \n### External Keys\n\np2panda uses Ed25519 as the Digital Signature Algorithm.\
  \ To allow other DSAs we need to implement a _handshake_ process where external\
  \ identity systems such as an Ethereum key can authorise an MLS group member. This\
  \ will involve adding another data schema to p2panda.\n\n**Further Links**\n\n-\

  \n### POC: Group chat in Circles client\n\nAs a proof-of-concept (POC) we will integrate\
  \ p2panda with MLS into an existing Ethereum application in the Gnosis community.\
  \ Since our team partly consists of the original developers of the Circles ecosystem\
  \ we want to use the current Circles web client to show how Ethereum addresses (Gnosis\
  \ Safe contracts) can be used as receiver addresses for an encrypted MLS chat group.\n\
  \n* Users can associate their Gnosis Safe address (\"Circles profile\") with a p2panda\
  \ key\n* Users can create and manage groups to communicate with a set of other Safe\
  \ addresses\n* Users can access their chats from all of their devices simultaneously\n\
  \n**Further Links**\n\n- Circles website: https://joincircles.net/\n- Circles client:\
  \ https://circles.garden/\n\n### Security Audit\n\nThe OpenMLS team which partly\
  \ consists of the IETF standard editors consulted us already with the correct integration\
  \ of MLS into p2panda. We will continue with this collaboration. To verify our work\
  \ and gather feedback we want to work with Least Authority for a security audit.\
  \ \n\n- OpenMLS: https://openmls.tech/\n- Least Authority: https://leastauthority.com/\n\
  \n## Rationale\n\nScaleable data encryption for large groups in a decentralised\
  \ network is hard and has always involved a trade-off between UX and security. We\
  \ believe that MLS is the first [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/)\
  \ to tackle some of these challenges. p2p applications of all kinds, for example\
  \ the Gnosis Safe Apps, will benefit from an off-chain protocol that gives them\
  \ a distributed, strongly encrypted database stack.\n\nOne goal of p2panda's protocol\
  \ design has been enabling both usage from native apps, independent of a stable\
  \ connection to the internet, and immediate access from a plain web browser, without\
  \ having to install any additional software. Additionally, p2panda keeps data portable\
  \ instead of locking it to a specific application or server. Our design works in\
  \ both federated network topologies and fully decentralised systems, both of which\
  \ can be configured depending on the needs of the software and the communities that\
  \ are operating it.\n\nEthereum addresses (EOA and Contract account, for example\
  \ of a Gnosis Safe) are ideal identifiers for applications like a distributed messaging\
  \ platform. They are already established in the community, simplify onboarding and\
  \ enable cross-validation of identities through previous usage of those keys. Protocols\
  \ with centralised registries like PGP/GPG failed here and we believe that Ethereum\
  \ addresses that are native to decentralised networks are much more suitable for\
  \ this task. We want to enable any holder of an Ethereum key to bring their identity\
  \ and access additional tools for the community.\n\n## Budget\n\n- 172.800 DAI -\

  \nSecure encryption for large groups is a complex problem which gets even harder\
  \ in a decentralised setting. With the new [Messaging Layer Security Protocol](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks)\
  \ (MLS) and [p2panda](https://p2panda.org) as the decentralisation layer we want\
  \ to introduce a solution that can account for a range of community-, threat- and\
  \ networking models. At the same time we want to provide accessible and well-documented\
  \ APIs for developers to easily build their solutions on top."
