title: Should Gnosis DAO provide grants for Omen 2.0 initiative?
body: "## 2\\. Funding - Rewards/Reimbursements\n\n#### Category\n\nFunding - Rewards\
  \ and Reimbursement\n\n#### Executive Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a grant to\
  \ develop a frontend for the Omen prediction market, that leverages AI agents to\
  \ both create and predict market outcomes. The platform will offer users insights\
  \ into real-world event predictions while enhancing the overall user experience.\
  \ The requested grant of 400K WXDAI and 600 GNO will be used to fund the development\
  \ and maintenance of the Omen frontend.\n\n#### Specification\n\nThe proposed reward\
  \ and reimbursement program includes 400K WXDAI and 600 GNO for the development\
  \ and maintenance of the Omen 2.0 frontend, along with the transfer of the Omen.eth\
  \ ENS for branding and platform management. These funds will be allocated as follows:\
  \ 70% for product development, testing, and maintenance; 15% for marketing; 3% for\
  \ infrastructure; and 12% for project management. This program aims to drive user\
  \ growth on Gnosis Chain, augment the Gnosis AI team and its prediction market agents,\
  \ and support new initiatives and experiments across the broader Gnosis network.\n\
  \n##### Technical Specifications\n\nThe Presagio frontend is being developed on\
  \ React with Next.js, building upon the original OMEN conditional tokens contracts\
  \ written by Gnosis.\n\nKey integrations include Gnosis AI APIs, The Graph and Dune.\
  \ Gnosis AI API is used to fetch real-time market insights. We seek to use Gnosis\
  \ AI API for new functionalities (e.g. market creation, agent insights). Future\
  \ enhancements will involve building a back-end solution to improve data fetching\
  \ efficiency, improving users experience and new functionalities (e.g. database\
  \ to store data for user favorite markets for example).\n\nA comments section is\
  \ also planned, with an integration of a partner-provided solution (preferably in\
  \ web3 space), to allow user discussions within the platform.\n\n#### Rationale\n\
  \nThe past couple of months, there has been a great amount of traction in prediction\
  \ market area with Polymarket raising 70M in investment and there has been considerable\
  \ user growth in Polymarket, limitless.exchange and manifold.markets. At Dappcon,\
  \ there has been plenty of talks and discussions around AI, the kind of risks it\
  \ poses, the challenges it has and how AI and blockchain could become an unstoppable\
  \ force that needs to be kept a close watch. Gnosis has also been ahead of its time\
  \ in terms of all the products they launch and this vision aligns well with the\
  \ Gnosis AI and the investment they have made on AI agents.\n\nDuring Dappcon 2024,\
  \ we showcased the new UI we had started building for prediction markets and asked\
  \ for feedback from Martin. We explored a few possibilities around how we could\
  \ build a frontend for Omen, where we see the predictions that AI makes and the\
  \ research that it does when making a prediction. We will also be able to see how\
  \ each AI agent is performing, comparing them against each other.\n\n#### Budget\n\
  \nAs part of the proposal, we would also be looking forward to receive a grant of\
  \ 400K in WXDAI and 600 GNO (will be used as a validator for 1 year)\n\nThe funding\
  \ will be used for the following:\n\n  * Development, testing and maintenance of\
  \ the product - 70%\n  * Marketing - 15%\n  * Infrastructure costs - 3%\n  * Project\
  \ / Product management - 12%\n\n\n\nTransfer omen.eth ENS to a new multisig for\
  \ branding, frontend deployment and management.  \nWe would also like to work closely\
  \ with the Gnosis AI team to understand and explore the possibility to make the\
  \ agents get better at creating markets and predicting them.\n\n**Milestones:**\n\
  \n## Milestones: Timeline, Implementations and Deliverable\n\n### Milestone 1 -\
  \ Support Omen 2.0 (Completed)\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n  * Base features: \n   \
  \ * The dapp should be able to show all the binary markets and the spread for each\
  \ market.\n    * In the markets page, any user should be able to buy and sell the\
  \ outcome tokens with the wallet connected.\n    * Searching and filtering of markets.\n\
  \    * There should be a way to see the activity history and a graph depicting the\
  \ fluctuations in the outcome of a market.\n    * Show markets that are based on\
  \ different collateral tokens.\n    * Redemption of outcome tokens once the market\
  \ is resolved.\n    * “My bets” page with a list of all the markets that the user\
  \ has predicted.\n\n\n\n**Time and Price Estimate:** We are completed with this\
  \ milestone and we worked on it for close to 4 months from March to June 2024. We\
  \ estimate 100K for this.\n\n### Milestone 2 - Support for AI agents\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\
  \n  * A filter for all the markets created by the AI agents. (Completed)\n  * Visualize\
  \ whether a particular transaction is created by one of the AI agents. (Completed)\n\
  \  * Display the resolution status and oracle, based on reality.eth oracle answering\
  \ process (Completed)\n  * Connect with Gnosis AI APIs to show relevant articles\
  \ related to the market. (Completed)\n  * Profile view (Completed)\n  * Wallet Prediction\
  \ metrics (Completed)\n  * Support for Devconflict (In Progress)\n\n\n\n**Time and\
  \ Price Estimate:** We estimate this will be done by Oct 2024 and we estimate 100K\
  \ for this.\n\n### Milestone 3 - Support for AI agents, more market types, redesign\n\
  \n**Deliverables:**\n\n  * AI research - If the transaction is from an AI agent,\
  \ link the research article, the model used and the confidence rating that had been\
  \ used to arrive at the decision. This is done by integrating with Autonolas mechs\
  \ and Gnosis AI.\n  * AI agents overview - Display AI agents performance across\
  \ various markets.\n  * AI agents’ leaderboard - most success, most active, category\
  \ based info.\n  * Expand to categorical markets.\n  * Support for adding liquidity\n\
  \  * Support for market creation.\n  * Redesign of the dapp\n  * Featured markets\n\
  \  * Work on marketing towards building a brand for Omen in the socials.\n  * Work\
  \ on documentation on how markets are created, bet on and resolved.\n\n\n\n**Time\
  \ and Price Estimate:** We estimate this will be done by Mar 2025 and we estimate\
  \ 120K for this.\n\n### Milestone 4 - More use cases\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n  *\
  \ Add support to have a comment section within each market.\n  * Show Related markets\n\
  \  * Shareable market iframe\n  * Watchlist\n  * Add support for limit orders and\
  \ stop loss orders. This will need a lot of activity to wrap the ERC1155 to a ERC20,\
  \ update the liquidity management by the AI agent market creator to add liquidity\
  \ on Swapr V3 and then get help from solvers to tap into these pools for adding\
  \ support.\n\n\n\n**Time and Price Estimate:** We estimate this will be done by\
  \ June 2025 and we estimate 80K for this.\n\nAlso, we would like to be a bit elastic\
  \ in our milestones based on the inputs from users and community.\n\n## Evaluation\n\
  \n**Technical performance:**\n\n  * Ensure that the frontend performs seamlessly\
  \ and smoothly without any severe issues.\n  * Gnosis AI integration: Evaluate new\
  \ integration possibilities with Gnosis AI APIs for market insights, prediction\
  \ research and accuracy.\n\n\n\n**User engagement and experience:**\n\n  * Grow\
  \ the amount of transactions using Omen by at least 500%. We will have a separate\
  \ dune dashboard for overall TVL, transactions and the volume.\n\n\n\n**Milestone\
  \ based progress:**\n\n  * Successful shipping of features described in each of\
  \ the milestones.\n\n\n\n**Community involvement:**\n\n  * Regular updates to the\
  \ community, GnosisDAO\n  * New branding for Omen and reflect the new direction\
  \ and vision\n\n\n\n## Team/ Organization\n\nThe Presagio team comprises Leo, Diogo,\
  \ Rorry, Nicki, Akash, and Venky. As a cohesive unit, we have collaborated for over\
  \ a year to deliver notable projects such as Swapr’s CLAMM (< on Gnosis chain and\
  \ Stackly (< deployed on Mainnet, Gnosis chain and Arbitrum, all built atop CoW\
  \ protocol infrastructure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPresagio (Omen 2.0) represents a\
  \ significant step in the evolution of prediction markets, blending the AI infrastructure\
  \ within the Gnosis ecosystem. The requested funding will enable the development,\
  \ maintenance and the growth of the platform bringing Omen to a position of leading\
  \ AI agent driven prediction market space.\n\n8 Likes\n"
