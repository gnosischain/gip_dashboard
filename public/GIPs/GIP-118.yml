title: Should sDAI be replaced by sUSDS in the bridge?
body: "#### Executive Summary\n\nSince MakerDAO became Sky and started issuing their\
  \ USDS stablecoin, they have also introduced the Sky Savings Rate (SSR), which is\
  \ now typically 1% higher than the DAI Savings Rate (DSR). This proposal aims to\
  \ replace the current sDAI in the bridge on Ethereum’s side with sUSDS in order\
  \ to increase the yield for the Gnosis sDAI. The native Gnosis Chain token would\
  \ remain xDAI.\n\n#### Introduction\n\nGnosis Chain has used xDAI, which is DAI\
  \ bridged from mainnet, as its native token since inception. However, with the recent\
  \ changes by MakerDAO / Sky, and their push for USDS instead of DAI, it has become\
  \ clear that we need to stay current with the broader ecosystem in order to remain\
  \ relevant and get access to the best yield.\n\n#### Proposed Changes\n\nThe bridge\
  \ would require an upgrade, that would include:\n\n  * Swapping all the sDAI currently\
  \ held by the bridge to sUSDS \n    * Similarly to an upgrade made last year (Deposit\
  \ DAI of the xDAI bridge in sDAI vault from Spark)\n  * Adding support for depositing\
  \ USDS instead in addition to DAI \n    * DAI would get swapped 1:1 for USDS and\
  \ then sUSDS in the bridge\n  * Replacing the currency for withdrawal from DAI to\
  \ USDS on Ethereum\n\n\n\nAs an alternative, we could also introduce an option to\
  \ automatically swap back to DAI instead of USDS, although this might incur a fee\
  \ later down the line.\n\n#### Impact and Benefits\n\nThe main benefit is that we\
  \ would get higher yield (typically 1% more) on the stablecoins in our bridge. Currently,\
  \ the SSR is at 12.5%, while the DSR is at 11.5%.\n\nThe main impacts are:\n\n \
  \ * We would be trusting USDS, which has a blacklist function, instead of DAI, which\
  \ is more neutral. However, one could argue that the trust assumptions are similar,\
  \ as the same company ultimately manages the underlying assets. It would also be\
  \ an extremely bad precedent for them to blacklist a bridge.\n  * Users that bridged\
  \ DAI into Gnosis would now be forced to withdraw USDS. This could also potentially\
  \ impact smart contracts, that could rely on the bridge to provide them with DAI\
  \ instead of USDS, which could result in them breaking. A thorough analysis will\
  \ be conducted beforehand to make sure that no smart contract currently relies on\
  \ this.\n\n\n\n#### Implementation Plan\n\n  1. Make sure that no smart contract\
  \ relies on getting DAI from the bridge rather than a different token (in this case\
  \ USDS)\n  2. Implement and test a bridge upgrade that covers the proposed changes\n\
  \  3. Submit the upgrade to the bridge signers\n\n\n\n#### Risks and Challenges\n\
  \nThe main challenge is to make sure that the community agrees on this change, which\
  \ is why we’re gauging interest with this GIP.\n\nObviously, there’s always a risk\
  \ in deploying and upgrading smart contracts, but our team is experienced and has\
  \ successfully implemented many such upgrades. All changes will of course be audited\
  \ and tested thoroughly on Chiado.\n\n#### Team / Organization\n\nThis would mostly\
  \ be taken care of by the bridge team.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nWe believe that it\
  \ is time to leave DAI behind in favor of USDS, which is now being pushed by Sky,\
  \ in order to benefit from the higher yield on sUSDS in comparison to sDAI.\n\n\
