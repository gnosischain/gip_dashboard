title: Should sDAI be replaced by sUSDS in the bridge?
body: "**Executive Summary**\nSince MakerDAO became Sky and started issuing their\
  \ USDS stablecoin, they have also introduced the Sky Savings Rate (SSR), which is\
  \ now typically 1.5% higher than the DAI Savings Rate (DSR). This proposal aims\
  \ to replace the current sDAI in the bridge on Ethereum’s side with sUSDS in order\
  \ to increase the yield for the Gnosis sDAI 3. The native Gnosis Chain token would\
  \ remain xDAI.\n\n**Introduction**\nGnosis Chain has used xDAI, which is DAI bridged\
  \ from mainnet, as its native token since inception. However, with the recent changes\
  \ by MakerDAO / Sky, and their push for USDS instead of DAI, it has become clear\
  \ that we need to stay current with the broader ecosystem in order to remain relevant\
  \ and get access to the best yield.\n\n**Proposed Changes**\nThe bridge would require\
  \ an upgrade, that would include:\n\n- Swapping all the sDAI currently held by the\
  \ bridge to sUSDS\n  - Similarly to an upgrade made last year (Deposit DAI of the\
  \ xDAI bridge in sDAI vault from Spark 3)\n- Adding support for depositing USDS\
  \ in addition to DAI\n  - DAI would get swapped 1:1 for USDS and then sUSDS in the\
  \ bridge\n- Replacing the currency for withdrawal from DAI to USDS on Ethereum\n\
  \nAs an alternative, we could also introduce an option to automatically swap back\
  \ to DAI instead of USDS, although this might incur a fee later down the line.\n\
  \n**Impact and Benefits**\nThe main benefit is that we would get higher yield (typically\
  \ 1.5% more) on the stablecoins in our bridge. Currently, the SSR is at 8.75%, while\
  \ the DSR is at 7.25%.\n\nThe main impacts are:\n\n- We would be trusting USDS,\
  \ which has a blacklist function, instead of DAI, which is more neutral. However,\
  \ one could argue that the trust assumptions are similar, as the same company ultimately\
  \ manages the underlying assets. It would also be an extremely bad precedent for\
  \ them to blacklist a bridge.\n- Users that bridged DAI into Gnosis would now be\
  \ forced to withdraw USDS. This could also potentially impact smart contracts, that\
  \ could rely on the bridge to provide them with DAI instead of USDS, which could\
  \ result in them breaking. A thorough analysis will be conducted beforehand to make\
  \ sure that no smart contract currently relies on this.\n\n**Implementation Plan**\n\
  - Finish testing and auditing. Should be done in around one month.\n- Deployment\
  \ in 2 phases, separated by 1-2 months to give every user and app ample time to\
  \ move the router instead of using the bridges directly.\n  1) Implement a router\
  \ for the bridge. This is a single smart contract that will route to the xDAI Bridge\
  \ or the Omni Bridge depending on the token, and can be reconfigured in scenarios\
  \ like USDC/USDC.e. It will be used to allow deposits in USDS and DAI.\n  2) Move\
  \ away from (s)DAI as the primary token to (s)USDS, while keeping a 1:1 bridge from\
  \ DAI to xDAI possible through the router.\n- Implement and test a bridge upgrade\
  \ that covers the proposed changes. Will be done in parallel with phase 1.\n\n**Risks\
  \ and Challenges**\nThe main challenge is to make sure that the community agrees\
  \ on this change, which is why we’re gauging interest with this GIP.\n\nObviously,\
  \ there’s always a risk in deploying and upgrading smart contracts, but our team\
  \ is experienced and has successfully implemented many such upgrades. All changes\
  \ will of course be audited and tested thoroughly on Chiado.\n\n**Team / Organization**\n\
  This would mostly be taken care of by the bridge team.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe believe\
  \ that it is time to leave DAI behind in favor of USDS, which is now being pushed\
  \ by Sky, in order to benefit from the higher yield on sUSDS in comparison to sDAI."
