  \ add delegation & spam reduction?\n    author: Gnosis Guild\n    status: Draft\n\
  \    type: Meta\n    created: 2023-01-20\n    \n\n  * Let’s do this!\n  * Make no\
  \ change\n\n\n\n0 voters\n\n##  Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce\
  \ a number of changes to GnosisDAO’s governance setup which will:\n\n  1. Reduce\
  \ low-quality and spam proposals created in the GnosisDAO’s snapshot space.\n  2.\
  \ Make GnosisDAO’s influence distribution less opaque.\n  3. Improve vote-weight\
  \ utilization.\n\n\n\n##  Abstract\n\nBroadly, this proposal aims to introduce two\
  \ changes:\n\n  1. Modify the criteria for users to post proposals to the GnosisDAO’s\
  \ snapshot space. \n    1. Accounts holding ≥ 1 GNO can create a proposal (current).\n\
  \    2. Add some trusted moderators that have the ability to remove posts that they\
  \ deem to be low-quality. (new)\n    3. Proposals with less than < 1,000 GNO of\
  \ vote-weight cast `for` or `abstain` are filtered from the main view. (new)\n \
  \ 2. Improve delegation \n    1. Improve the delegation UI inside of snapshot to\
  \ make delegation much simpler and to give an overview of the current delegated\
  \ vote-weight distribution.\n    2. Add a two-year term limit to delegation, to\
  \ avoid stagnation in the vote-weight distribution; GNO holders must periodically\
  \ set their delegation, all delegations expire after two-years.\n    3. Allow delegates\
  \ to decline being delegated to / resign from delegation, negating any vote weight\
  \ delegated to them.\n    4. Allow GNO holders to delegate portions of their vote\
  \ weight to multiple accounts.\n    5. Allow for transitive delegation; If A delegates\
  \ to B and B delegates to C, C inherits A’s vote weight.\n    6. Allow delegates\
  \ to optionally set a cap on the amount of vote weight delegated to them.\n\n\n\n\
  ##  Motivation\n\nPopularized by Compound Governor, delegation has proven to be\
  \ an effective strategy for improving the vote-weight utilization in many DAOs;\
  \ consolidating vote-weight in the hands of those who have the time and inclination\
  \ to actively participate in governance by allowing users to delegate their vote\
  \ weight to others.\n\nLargely due to the constraints of calculating vote-weight\
  \ on-chain, Compound and OZ Governor’s delegation is somewhat limited. GnosisDAO’s\
  \ existing delegation strategy on Snapshot already improves on one of these limitations\
  \ by allowing users to delegate their vote weight and also directly participate\
  \ in any vote. If a user does not cast a vote, their vote weight will be applied\
  \ to the vote cast by their delegate. If a user does cast a vote, their vote weight\
  \ will not count towards their delegates vote weight in that proposal.\n\nHowever,\
  \ there is significant design-space to further improve on GnosisDAO’s delegation.\n\
  \nSpecifically, we would like to introduce changes that:\n\n  1. Reduce low-quality\
  \ and spam proposals created in the GnosisDAO’s snapshot space.\n  2. Make GnosisDAO’s\
  \ influence distribution less opaque.\n  3. Improve vote-weight utilization.\n\n\
  \n\n[Another recent forum](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/enhancing-transparency-and-efficiency-an-idea-for-the-implementation-of-a-governance-structure-based-on-delegates-in-the-gnosis-ecosystem/6334)\
  \ post also argues for delegation, along with suggesting compensation for delegates.\
  \ To constrain scope, this proposal does not include delegate compensation. However,\
  \ if this proposal is successful, and after observing the delegation setup in production,\
  \ we will likely write a followup proposal to implement some form of delegate compensation.\n\

  \ This is an amazing proposal that addresses many issues and adds great improvements\
  \ to delegate voting!  \nI’m in support and ofc will vote for the proposal\n\nIt\
  \ is also in line with many improvements that we were considering for CoW DAO. We\
  \ will definitely be looking to use these new tooling to introduce a delegation\
  \ program for the CoW DAO, piggy backing on your work.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/user_avatar/forum.gnosis.io/auryn_macmillan/48/97_2.png)\

  \nThis should ideally also include information about the term expiration for each\
  \ delegate, so delegates and users are aware of upcoming expirations.\n\nFew additional\
  \ ideas I had:\n\n  * Improve the profile page to include a space-specific bio field.\
  \ This bio will be used if the user was chosen to be displayed as delegate in the\
  \ “[delegate](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate/cow.eth)” page\n  * Improve the “delegate”\
  \ page - Add a space defined delegate-list strategy. This will define which profiles\
  \ are eligible to be displayed to users when they go to the “delegate” page and\
  \ look for delegates. In addition the strategy will define the order in which the\
  \ delegate list is displayed. Either top delegates like it is today, or randomly\
  \ ordered, or any other arbitrary sorting. (I assume this will have a significant\
  \ bias effect on delegate choice, so at least space owners can control WHO is being\
  \ displayed and in WHAT order)\n\n\n\n2 Likes\n\n[auryn_macmillan](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/auryn_macmillan)\

  \ cmagan:\n\n> For this feature, I assume the exact configuration will be exposed\

  \ be configurable.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/user_avatar/forum.gnosis.io/cmagan/48/629_2.png)\
  \ cmagan:\n\n> Where users would be able to find the low quality proposals?\n\n\
  Not sure about this yet. Admins in Snapshot are currently able to archive proposals,\
  \ so I’d imagine that low quality proposals are also put in this same state.\n\n\

  \n> Where those settings will be exposed?\n\nI’m honestly not sure yet. I think\
  \ we’ll probably modify the delegate tab on Snapshot, so perhaps this is the natural\
  \ place for these settings to live.\n\n1 Like\n\n[Sisyphos](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Sisyphos)\
  \ January 23, 2023, 4:47am  4\n\nThanks for posting this [@auryn_macmillan](/u/auryn_macmillan),\
  \ and to the team that worked on it!\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/user_avatar/forum.gnosis.io/auryn_macmillan/48/97_2.png)\
  \ auryn_macmillan:\n\n> Add some trusted moderators that have the ability to remove\
  \ posts that they deem to be low-quality. (new)\n\nThis could be clear for most\
  \ of all who have been looking at the snapshot space recently, but some examples\
  \ or general guidelines may help interpret it. E.g. low quality means the GIP is\
  \ not following the GIP template [GIP-0: Template](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-0-template/734).\n\
  \nAre moderators going to be known, e.g. information added to the space bio, for\
  \ people to reach out if they are looking for feedback?\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/user_avatar/forum.gnosis.io/auryn_macmillan/48/97_2.png)\
  \ auryn_macmillan:\n\n>   * Allow delegates to optionally set a cap on the amount\
  \ of vote weight delegated to them.\n> \n\n\nI was wondering if a cap on max delegation\
  \ would help in:\n\n  * Create some additional friction for people that have enough\
  \ vote power to guarantee quorum\n  * Avoid the perception that participating in\
  \ snapshot voting may be pointless when one wallet is seen to provide quorum and\
  \ make a decision.\n\n\n\nIt is granted that such a user could still delegate to\
  \ more than one wallet in their control. But I thought it may be worth the time\
  \ considering those two bullets if the effort to implement it is reasonable.\n\n\

  \ Sisyphos:\n\n> E.g. low quality means the GIP is not following the GIP template\
  \ [GIP-0: Template](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-0-template/734).\n\nAgreed. The\
  \ rules around moderation will need to be explicit.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/user_avatar/forum.gnosis.io/sisyphos/48/1152_2.png)\
  \ Sisyphos:\n\n> Are moderators going to be known, e.g. information added to the\
  \ space bio, for people to reach out if they are looking for feedback?\n\nI assume\
  \ the moderators will be a subset of the forum moderators. Likely it would be [@john_szczepaniak](/u/john_szczepaniak)\
  \ and perhaps a small handful of others.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/user_avatar/forum.gnosis.io/sisyphos/48/1152_2.png)\
  \ Sisyphos:\n\n> I was wondering if a cap on max delegation would help\n\nAs you\
  \ said, such a user could trivially delegate to more than one wallet, so I think\
  \ this is probably a moot point. If we want to make it more challenging for a single\
  \ entity to reach quorum, we would need to explore different ways to weighting votes;\
  \ quadratic voting, for example.\n\n3 Likes\n\n[srv](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/srv)\
  \ January 25, 2023, 1:49pm  6\n\nThank you [@auryn_macmillan](/u/auryn_macmillan)\
  \ for posting this!\n\nI would suggest some alternatives to this point : `Allow\
  \ for transitive delegation; If A delegates to B and B delegates to C, C inherits\
  \ A’s vote weight.`\n\nAs a GNO holder, I’d like to avoid delegated accounts to\
  \ sub-delegate my vote power indefinitely, I think it’s everyone’s right to decide\
  \ on whether or not transitive delegation should be enabled, probably we can have\
  \ an option to allow/block that behaviour.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n2 Likes\n\n\
  [auryn_macmillan](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/auryn_macmillan) January 25, 2023, 9:51pm\
  \  7\n\nIt’s certainly an option we can explore, but my knee-jerk objections to\
  \ this are:\n\n  1. It likely adds some complexity to the implementation.\n  2.\
  \ It would likely reduce vote-weight utilization, since A’s vote would not end up\
  \ being used if B delegates to C, and neither A nor B vote directly.\n  3. It feels\
  \ somewhat redundant. Practically, there is very little difference between B delegating\
  \ to C and B mirroring Cs vote. In either case, A’s vote ends up being cast in the\
  \ same way as C. However, the latter required B’s active participation in each proposal,\
  \ which probably reduces vote-weight utilization (as in 2).\n  4. This seems like\
  \ an issue between A and B. If A does not want their vote weight delegated further,\
  \ they should pick a delegate who promises not to delegate further. If B delegates\
  \ to C, then A can always vote directly to override that vote weight and/or change\
  \ their delegation.\n\n\n\n1 Like\n\n[coltron.eth](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/coltron.eth)\
