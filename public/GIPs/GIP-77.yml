title: Should the GnosisDAO add delegation & spam reduction?
body: "##  Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce a number of changes to\
  \ GnosisDAO’s governance setup which will:\n\n  1. Reduce low-quality and spam proposals\
  \ created in the GnosisDAO’s snapshot space.\n  2. Make GnosisDAO’s influence distribution\
  \ less opaque.\n  3. Improve vote-weight utilization.\n\n\n\n##  Abstract\n\nBroadly,\
  \ this proposal aims to introduce two changes:\n\n  1. Modify the criteria for users\
  \ to post proposals to the GnosisDAO’s snapshot space. \n    1. Accounts holding\
  \ ≥ 1 GNO can create a proposal (current).\n    2. Add some trusted moderators that\
  \ have the ability to remove posts that they deem to be low-quality. (new)\n   \
  \ 3. Proposals with less than < 1,000 GNO of vote-weight cast `for` or `abstain`\
  \ are filtered from the main view. (new)\n  2. Improve delegation \n    1. Improve\
  \ the delegation UI inside of snapshot to make delegation much simpler and to give\
  \ an overview of the current delegated vote-weight distribution.\n    2. Add a two-year\
  \ term limit to delegation, to avoid stagnation in the vote-weight distribution;\
  \ GNO holders must periodically set their delegation, all delegations expire after\
  \ two-years.\n    3. Allow delegates to decline being delegated to / resign from\
  \ delegation, negating any vote weight delegated to them.\n    4. Allow GNO holders\
  \ to delegate portions of their vote weight to multiple accounts.\n    5. Allow\
  \ for transitive delegation; If A delegates to B and B delegates to C, C inherits\
  \ A’s vote weight.\n    6. Allow delegates to optionally set a cap on the amount\
  \ of vote weight delegated to them.\n\n\n\n##  Motivation\n\nPopularized by Compound\
  \ Governor, delegation has proven to be an effective strategy for improving the\
  \ vote-weight utilization in many DAOs; consolidating vote-weight in the hands of\
  \ those who have the time and inclination to actively participate in governance\
  \ by allowing users to delegate their vote weight to others.\n\nLargely due to the\
  \ constraints of calculating vote-weight on-chain, Compound and OZ Governor’s delegation\
  \ is somewhat limited. GnosisDAO’s existing delegation strategy on Snapshot already\
  \ improves on one of these limitations by allowing users to delegate their vote\
  \ weight and also directly participate in any vote. If a user does not cast a vote,\
  \ their vote weight will be applied to the vote cast by their delegate. If a user\
  \ does cast a vote, their vote weight will not count towards their delegates vote\
  \ weight in that proposal.\n\nHowever, there is significant design-space to further\
  \ improve on GnosisDAO’s delegation.\n\nSpecifically, we would like to introduce\
  \ changes that:\n\n  1. Reduce low-quality and spam proposals created in the GnosisDAO’s\
  \ snapshot space.\n  2. Make GnosisDAO’s influence distribution less opaque.\n \
  \ 3. Improve vote-weight utilization.\n\n\n\nAnother recent forum post also argues\
  \ for delegation, along with suggesting compensation for delegates. To constrain\
  \ scope, this proposal does not include delegate compensation. However, if this\
  \ proposal is successful, and after observing the delegation setup in production,\
  \ we will likely write a followup proposal to implement some form of delegate compensation.\n\
