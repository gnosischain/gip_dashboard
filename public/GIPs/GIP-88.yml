title: Should Gnosis Chain provide liquidity for Circles Group Currencies in collaboration
  w/Proof of Humanity?
body: "http://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-88-should-gnosis-chain-provide-liquidity-for-circles-group-currencies-in-collaboration-w-proof-of-humanity/6983\n\
  \nauthor: Julio Linares, Clément Lesaege \n\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\nCirclesUBI\
  \ is a dapp running on Gnosis Chain which distributes a Universal Basic Income (UBI)\
  \ via a P2P mesh credit protocol. Recently, a secondary issuance mechanism has been\
  \ developed, called Group Currencies, as a way to bridge Circles to state money\
  \ systems and crypto-assets. We propose that Gnosis Chain provides liquidity to\
  \ two specific group currencies: the BER group currency administered by the Circles\
  \ Coop e.G. and the Proof of Humanity (POH) group currency administered by the POH\
  \ Origin team. By partnering with projects like Monerium, the goal is to pave the\
  \ way to position Circles as a leading real world payment application that provides\
  \ a UBI to people worldwide, strengthening the Gnosis ecosystem. The total costs\
  \ of the project are 1,700,000 EUR for a period of one year from the moment the\
  \ proposal gets accepted by the Gnosis DAO.\n\nSpecification\n\nCircles (CRC) are\
  \ minted as personal currencies at a rate of roughly 1 CRC per 1 hour or 24 CRC\
  \ per day, with a yearly 7% demurrage on the money supply to incentivise circulation.\
  \ The current socially agreed exchange rate of CRC to e.g. Euros is roughly 10:1.\
  \ Group currencies are minted on a 1:1 basis, so that for each group currency minted,\
  \ one personal currency gets deposited and locked into a specific treasury. Group\
  \ currencies have three modes of issuance or minting:\n\n1. Only the owner can mint.\n\
  2. Only the group can mint.\n3. Everyone can mint.\n\nIn order to test group currencies\
  \ at a larger scale, the following proposal seeks to grant the ability to exchange\
  \ Circles group currencies for the following groups:\n\n1. Proof of Humanity (Origin):\
  \ in order to establish a clear collaboration and integration between POH-Origin\
  \ and CirclesUBI, we propose a group currency that is used by POH-Origin users who\
  \ join the Circles POH group currency as part of their basic income distribution\
  \ system. POH is a sybil resistance registry that wants to use Circles group currency\
  \ for UBI distribution. We propose that Gnosis Chain commits to fund a total of\
  \ 500.000 EUR to bring liquidity onto their group currency (the liquidity will stay\
  \ owned by the Gnosis DAO). More information about POH's recent fork can be found\
  \ [here](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-binding-hip-74-a-peaceful-fork/2487).\
  \ Technically, the PoH system would have a group currency manager for the creation\
  \ of its Circles group currency. More details of that can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/AndreiMVP/63fe2376400ebb89ece633646aa8c625).\
  \ For more technical information you can find a GitHub repository for the POH GC,\
  \ which includes a README, [here](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/group-currency)\
  \ Additionally, [here](https://hackmd.io/@andreimvp/pohgct-guide) you can read a\
  \ more in-depth presentation/ testing guide for the PoH Group Currency. We believe\
  \ strong synergies can come from this collaboration between Circles and Proof of\
  \ Humanity (Origin) in the space, both powered by Gnosis chain.\n\n2. [Circles Coop](http://circles.coop/)\
  \ eG: as part of the ongoing Berlin Open Pilot, the Circles Coop provides Euros\
  \ in exchange for CRC that businesses accept in return for goods and services as\
  \ a way of increasing fungibility of CRC and incentivising local trade, enabling\
  \ a people-powered, bottom-up basic income. You can see more about the work of the\
  \ Circles Coop [here](https://vimeo.com/769402776). An analysis of the Berlin network\
  \ (December 2022) by the NetFi team at [Freiburg Institute of Basic Income Studies](https://www.fribis.uni-freiburg.de/en/fribis/)\
  \ can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1husreoJz3HQq9_C0LXRMiGRoC_hL5Uvxds9UwzTeeoI/edit?usp=sharing)\
  \ (using novel network science methods).\n\nBER Exchange\n\nNow that we have established\
  \ an active economic network in Berlin with over 2000 individual participants and\
  \ 20 merchant partners, the goal of the Circles Coop for the next year is to leverage\
  \ BER to create a sustainable community-driven investment environment for small\
  \ and medium businesses within the circles network in order to expand the basic\
  \ income economy. The group currency administered by the Circles Coop will be called\
  \ \"BER'', after Berlin. The BER will be backed by production of goods and services\
  \ coming from business sales in CRC. For the first years, we envision BER will be\
  \ issued as a service by the Circles Coop based on the CRC that businesses in the\
  \ network send to the Coop on a 1:1 basis. The Circles Coop will maintain a list\
  \ of trustees or people who commit to give labour, capital or land to the network\
  \ for the issuance of BER and other trade partners of the B2B network. After more\
  \ knowledge and experience is gathered from the workings of BER on the Circles'\
  \ web of trust, the Coop will begin to experiment with distributing group issuance\
  \ rules to the wider economic network.\n\n* BER will be sold for Euro-e to community\
  \ investors at a discount.\n* Euro-e will be given to the businesses in the Berlin\
  \ network either as direct zero/low interest loans or as part of the ongoing pilot\
  \ program.\n* Community investors can use BER to buy goods and services or sell\
  \ BER back for Euro-e at a fixed rate. This means that for the first year businesses\
  \ can only access BER through their own sales or by buying/selling BER with Euro-e\
  \ from other businesses or community investors.\n\nCo-payment API & Multi-Token\
  \ Display:\n\nIn order to do this, our aim is to make it easier for people and businesses\
  \ to co-pay with their CRC & BER by enabling Euros-e payments and multi-token display\
  \ of balances. The Circles Coop will leverage [Monerium](https://monerium.com/)’s\
  \ Euro-e stable coin, running on Gnosis, to develop a product that allows businesses\
  \ to withdraw and deposit Euro-e tokens to and from their [circles.garden](https://circles.garden/)\
  \ safe wallet. Monerium is a SEPA authorised and regulated Euro stable coin. Users\
  \ of Circles will be able to open a Monerium account with an IBAN to deposit Euro-e\
  \ tokens to their Circles safe in order to use the open co-payment API functionality\
  \ that we will develop. Businesses can sell things at a discount in Euros and benefit\
  \ from higher sales experienced from participating in the Circles network. The Euro-e\
  \ fee revenues generated are transparent and can be split as distributed equity\
  \ for Circles users within the web of trust, for the pilot business costs and to\
  \ cover the Coop's operational costs in order to break even. The end result is fully\
  \ distributed credit issuance and internal liquidity provision made possible by\
  \ the Circles mesh credit p2p protocol and distributed equity through the revenues\
  \ generated from trade and investments to real production in the form of co-payment\
  \ fees & community investment in BER.\n\nThe proposal would be to fund the Circles\
  \ Coop with 1.2 million EUR from the moment this proposal becomes effective for\
  \ a period of 12 months to:\n\n* develop the co-payment API functionality in the\
  \ [circles.garden](https://circles.garden/) client and [marketplace](https://market.joincircles.net/en)\
  \ with Euro-e and BER\n* Enable Euro-e, BER & CRC multi-token displays.\n* develop\
  \ the BER/Euro-e exchange functionality for the Berlin pilot (500k EUR)\n* Research\
  \ & Development (see below)\n\nPart of this budget will be assigned by the Circles\
  \ Coop to the [Bitspossessed](https://bitspossessed.org/) developer collective (600k).\
  \ The Bitspossessed have been responsible for maintaining and developing the core\
  \ Circles UBI infrastructure and client (circles.garden) since [Sarah Friend](https://isthisa.com/)\
  \ and [Andreas Dzialocha](https://adz.garden/) co-founded the Bitspossessed after\
  \ technicaly launching CirclesUBI in October 2020, with the unconditional support\
  \ from [Martin Koppelmann](https://twitter.com/koeppelmann). As the Circles Protocol\
  \ is non-for-profit and meant to be a commons, the project relies on grants and\
  \ public/private donations for its operations at scale. Having a budget for core\
  \ development secured by the GnosisDAO will ensure the continued success of the\
  \ project and group currencies as a whole. The Circles Coop's operational non-development\
  \ costs will be secured by external private donations while the revenues generated\
  \ from BER and co-payments are established, tested and proven to work. The Circles\
  \ Coop aims to develop an open reproducible revenue model that allows other organised\
  \ cooperatives, businesses and groups doing Circles to earn a revenue and break-even\
  \ from fees in Euro-e/fiat co-payments, fiat withdrawals and deposits and group\
  \ currency exchange fees.\n\nOur end goal and vision for the future is to develop\
  \ a multi-currency p2p privacy-preserving payment app that brings investment for\
  \ local economies to thrive everywhere via CirclesUBI.\n\nThe Circles Coop eG commits\
  \ to sharing the progress, main learnings and achievements in Q3 of 2024 before\
  \ applying to further funding from the GnosisDAO community.\n\nFrom mid 2024 to\
  \ 2025, our aim is to develop with others in the ecosystem a Community Currency\
  \ Exchange as a stand-alone product to decentralise and incentivise investment in\
  \ group currencies in a privacy-preserving way. You can read more about the Circles\
  \ Coop [here](https://circles.coop/) and about our recent work on anonymous circles\
  \ or the Circles [Entropy Black Paper](https://circlesentropy.github.io/blackpaper/).\n\
  \nResearch\n\nIn order to understand better what the different risk profiles and\
  \ trade-offs of group currencies will be, we would like to include a budget to fund\
  \ the research work of BlockScience and Circles Coop Research team, who will work\
  \ in understanding and modelling what effects will the introduction of group currencies\
  \ have on the Circles web of trust network as a whole, providing a \"digital twin\"\
  \ of Circles with the capacity to perform deterministic backtesting and to perform\
  \ extrapolation under stylized scenarios. One of the product outcomes of research\
  \ is to determine, using network science, when an account is a real person or not\
  \ and create the necessary metrics and detection mechanisms for sybil resistance.\
  \ To that end, we request a total of 100k EUR to fund the great work of [Blockscience](https://block.science/)\
  \ and the Circles Coop research team for a period of six months.\n\nTimeline for\
  \ Circles Coop:\n\nResearch and Design (3 months): includes market research, design\
  \ research, design work on ideation, mock-ups for new features, user stories, risk\
  \ management on legal and economic fronts, network science and agent based modelling\
  \ research, fine tuning business model, ongoing maintenance, stabilisation and improvement\
  \ of technical infrastructure. Additionally, here we will review and do an audit\
  \ of the group currency contracts to make sure everything is secure before deployment.\n\
  \nDecision-Making and Planning Implementation (1 month): Systematize and cross-analyze\
  \ all the information gathered. Establish a common roadmap in all domains to implement\
  \ agreed features, prepare campaigns for general users, improve Coop's BER minting\
  \ and EUR redeeming procedures, start with design research for [marketplace](http://www.market.joincircles.net)\
  \ integration, ongoing maintenance and stabilisation of technological infrastructure.\n\
  \nFeatures Development and Implementation Phase 1 (3-4 months): Launch campaign\
  \ to prepare users for new features. Work on the feature of multi-token display\
  \ to start users getting used to this possibility, preparing circles.garden backend\
  \ and marketplace for co-payment API. Test, adjust and launch first features. Design\
  \ processes and platforms for community investment. Prepare a communication campaign\
  \ to reach out to community investors. Ongoing maintenance and stabilisation of\
  \ technological infrastructure. \n\nFeatures Development and Implementation Phase\
  \ 2 (3-4 months): Developing, testing and launching co-payment API features both\
  \ on circles.garden and the marketplace. Campaign to introduce co-payment and start\
  \ introducing economic justice/social investment narrative. Ongoing maintenance\
  \ and stabilisation of technological infrastructure. Lastly, work will go into research\
  \ and design of a currency exchange platform for Q3 2024.\n\nMilestones: \n\nQ1:\
  \ first stage of Group Currency research completed, GC contract audits fully done.\
  \ \n\nQ2: Design of features and workflows of GC \n partially completed.  Architecture\
  \ & spec for payment API defined. \n\nQ3: Design of features and workflows of GC\
  \ completed. Testnet goes live to begin testing features and assumptions. Second\
  \ stage of research completed. \n\nQ4: Group Currency and co-payments implemented\
  \ on the circles.garden wallet and marketplace \n\n\n Budget\n\nTo summarise, the\
  \ breakdown of the total budget of this proposal will be assigned as follows:\n\n\
  To Proof of Humanity Origin Team:\n\n* 500k EUR for POH group currency. This liquidity\
  \ belongs to GnosisDAO and will go to the users of POH directly. The idea is to\
  \ provide liquidity on PHC (Proof of Humanity Circles). The money will be used to\
  \ build a liquidity position of DAI-PHC.\nSince there wouldn't be any liquidity\
  \ initially, the POH team will need to buy it overtime to avoid slippage, for around\
  \ 50k€ of PHC over 5 months.\nThe POH team can handle those operations and then\
  \ send the liquidity tokens to the GnosisDAO.\nGiving the exact operations may be\
  \ hard as price of PHC may vary.\n\nProof of Humanity's Gnosis Chain Safe: 0x636a9f58182B8132A08777A8De0Ca0f63bc0C3aa\n\
  \nTo Circles Coop e.G.:\n\n- 100k EUR for Research collaboration with Blockscience\
  \ and the Circles Coop Research team (July 2023 to June 2024). Paid in DAI or USDC.\n\
  \n- 600k EUR for the Bitspossessed CirclesUBI Dev Team (July 2023 to June 2024).\
  \ Paid in DAI or USDC.\n\nBerlin CirclesUBI Pilot:\n\n* 500k EUR for BER Pilot -\
  \ as a commitment to exchange the Group currency (BER) for DAI or USDC. This liquidity\
  \ belongs to GnosisDAO and will go to the businesses in the pilot directly. The\
  \ BER minted will be sent to the Gnosis Treasury team in exchange for the stable\
  \ coin at a fixed rate of ~10 BER to 1 Euro with a small discounted exchange fee\
  \ as incentives for merchants. In the future proposals to GnosisDAO, we plan to\
  \ create a social dex (community currency exchange) to allow for different forms\
  \ of mutual staking, direct loans to the B2B network and more, in order to make\
  \ the operation economically sustainable.\n\nCircles Coop's Gnosis Chain Safe: 0xd9B58990cef69c2d222fD8f8CAf53477C5B79E28\n\
  \nTotal:\n\n1.7 million EUR for a period of one year.\n\nA more detailed cost breakdown\
  \ is given [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ORy9d2pw7IJoub05s5MuVLBD3kRyUqpQmJnMG1KhdR4/edit#gid=1813060761).\
  \ \n\nFunding should be given for the respective team public addresses present in\
  \ this proposal.\n\nWe look forward to our collaboration.\n\nCircles Coop e.G &\
