title: Should $10M in GNO be used to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain?
body: 'A large directive for the Gnosis Chain is to increase the user base and on-chain
  activity by strategically allocating funds from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote
  adoption. An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose, and we propose to
  use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. We propose providing
  up to $10M to incentivize the adoption of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain.


  Details for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3


  The $10M will be provided in GNO to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain.
  The incentives should be designed together with other projects, which are operating
  on top of Uniswap v3 such as Perpetual Protocol, Gelato, or Stakewise. This should
  allow for more sustainable utilization of Uniswap as Gnosis Chain doesnâ€™t have a
  team dedicated to Uniswap v3. The GNO can be used to incentivize liquidity but should
  not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing usage of Uniswap v3, including
  building new applications on top of Uniswap v3 should be supported. The goal is
  to spend the $10M in the time period of 2 years. Funds not used after two years
  would go back to GnosisDAO. The spending is limited to $10M and the transferred
  amount of GNO as part of the proposal. GnosisDAO can decide to top up this amount
  based on the outcome of this initiative.'
