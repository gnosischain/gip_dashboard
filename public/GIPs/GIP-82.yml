title: Should GnosisDAO co-fund a community owned forest / land art project (terra0)?
body: "## Summary\nThis proposal seeks Gnosis DAO to become a sponsor and partner\
  \ that would partially fund terra0 to support the development of a novel large-scale\
  \ art project in Germany that focuses on community-land stewardship managed by a\
  \ DAO. The project will expand the use cases of the Gnosis ecosystem by using Gnosis\
  \ infrastructure (Safe, Gnosis Chain, Zodiac) to manage and restore a forest over\
  \ an indefinite time period. The artistic development is being supported by Light\
  \ Art Space (LAS), a German art foundation focused on art, science, and technology\
  \ and will culminate in a large-scale exhibition in Berlin (3-6 months), allowing\
  \ for a broad, diverse, and non-native audience to be exposed to Gnosis and Web3.\n\
  \nIn parallel, terra0 will produce a legal framework allowing for the integration\
  \ of a Gnosis Safe with the formation of a German Verein. As part of this proposal,\
  \ terra0 will develop and provide tools to integrate Gnosis Safes with this framework\
  \ and use the project to establish an inaugural precedent.\n\nterra0 seeks 195,000\
  \ € from Gnosis DAO to help realize this ambitious project (~ 18.2% of 1,071,000\
  \ € total project budget). The grant from Gnosis would help fund the purchase of\
  \ a plot of land containing a forest in Germany and lay the groundwork for the legal\
  \ framework and application of a DAO as a Verein for a Gnosis Safe. With this funding\
  \ Gnosis DAO will:\n\nSponsor the terra0 land art project and be featured on exhibition\
  \ material, resulting in increased publicity, visibility, and user base for Gnosis,\
  \ Gnosis Chain, and Gnosis Safe within a new cultural sphere.\n\nSupport the development\
  \ of a new legal framework for DAOs resulting in a composable template engine for\
  \ Gnosis Safes which allows DAOs to be registered as a Verein in Germany, thereby\
  \ creating new real-life applications for DAOs built on Gnosis tools.\n\nReceive\
  \ an allocation of the tokens associated with the upcoming terra0 land art project\
  \ and DAO. We also see Gnosis DAO as a key community member and participant in the\
  \ project.\n\n## Background\nterra0 is a group of developers, artists, and researchers\
  \ who have been creating artworks and prototyping decentralized applications since\
  \ 2016. Through technical experimentation, artistic exploration, and stress-testing\
  \ legal frameworks related to natural resources, terra0 creates technological-augmented\
  \ ecosystems and questions the contemporary representation of the living environment.\
  \ In this final version of the project, realized for the first time on the scale\
  \ of an entire forest in Germany, terra0 will develop a framework for the collaborative\
  \ management of shared resources and explore alternative, non-exploitative valuations\
  \ of nature. terra0 plans to instantiate a DAO to cooperatively organize the restoration\
  \ of the ecosystem using bio-markers oriented towards greater biodiversity and resistance\
  \ to environmental pressures.\n\nPrevious terra0 works and prototypes can be seen\
  \ on our website. They have been exhibited and discussed at the 58th Carnegie International,\
  \ the 17th Architecture Biennial Venice, Canadian Centre for Architecture Montreal,\
  \ The Shed New York City, Kunsthalle Zürich, Francisco Carolinum Linz, Chronus Art\
  \ Center Shanghai, Furtherfield Gallery London, Schinkel Pavillon Berlin, and Vienna\
  \ Biennale, among others.\n\n## Motivation\nIt’s no secret that we are in the midst\
  \ of an ecological crisis spurred on, in large part, by excessive resource use and\
  \ extraction. In the West, our relationship with the environment has been defined\
  \ for centuries by land’s productive value, which has led to gross ecological mismanagement\
  \ and destabilization. terra0 seeks to re-orient this relationship towards intrinsic\
  \ ecological value by applying Web3 principles of decentralized collective governance,\
  \ communal ownership of public goods, and automated digital mediation in service\
  \ of environmental resilience and autonomy. The development of decentralized programmable\
  \ systems for exchanging value is giving rise to code and community-based digital\
  \ organizational structures that enable democratic control of property. Novel ecological\
  \ collectives such as those proposed by terra0 could distribute decision rights\
  \ based on immanent bio-regional agency, relationships, and proximal metrics.\n\n\
  ## Rationale\nAs a collective, terra0 has been experimenting for years with Gnosis\
  \ Safe as infrastructure for treasury management and as a trust anchor. Historically,\
  \ we see Gnosis Chain and community as a place where DAO experiments happen; one\
  \ we believe provides essential DAO infrastructure for the projects, affordable\
  \ txs, and a community that cares deeply about its development. Gnosis’ commitment\
  \ to open standards whose design philosophy is one of expandability, inclusivity,\
  \ and composability aligns with the terra0 ethos of experimenting with novel forms\
  \ of governance and communities centered around ecological commons.\n\nThe proposed\
  \ art project is of value to the Gnosis community as it engages a diverse audience\
  \ and is participatory in nature — pairing ecological narratives with a concrete\
  \ implementation of DAO governance. This includes visitors of the exhibition, online\
  \ DAO members, local stakeholders, an international art audience, and experts from\
  \ various fields. When combined with the timescale, exhibition, and participatory\
  \ nature of the terra0 land art project, presents a unique opportunity to engage\
  \ an audience that would not normally be accessible while increasing the capability\
  \ and usage of the Gnosis ecosystem and Gnosis Chain. The land and forest will function\
  \ as a permanent land art installation and be accompanied by an internationally\
  \ recognized and large-scale public exhibition organized by LAS in Berlin over the\
  \ period of 3-6 months — which may travel to other locations in the future. This\
  \ connection has the potential to enhance the public perception of Gnosis: applied\
  \ ecology and community governance have rarely been publicly discussed and tested\
  \ on such a scale.\n\nAdditionally, the application and implementation of mapping\
  \ a Verein onto a DAO will enhance how it can be perceived in a legal context —\
  \ one we hope will set a precedent that will allow for its legality to be recognized\
  \ in other locals, contexts, and jurisdictions while featuring Gnosis Chain and\
  \ tools as key components. Although the legal definition and context of a Verein\
  \ is unique to Germany, once incorporated, it allows for international members to\
  \ join the organization — therefore not only being bound to the members residing\
  \ in Germany (except seven core members). The possibility to integrate DAOs into\
  \ a concrete legal structure using the Verein is an important building block for\
  \ our project and enables real-world use cases in areas such as environmental protection\
  \ and restoration.\n\n## Implementation\nThe land art project will be developed\
  \ over the next year, in this process terra0 will purchase a plot of land containing\
  \ a forest (10-20 hectares) in nearby proximity to Berlin, instantiate a DAO to\
  \ augment the ecological agency of the ecosystem, and transfer the ownership of\
  \ the land to it. The DAO governs the token systems, enforces the sovereignty of\
  \ the underlying ecosystem, and mediates human oriented relations. The secondary\
  \ function of the DAO is that of providing a social space, thus contributing to\
  \ the stimulation of work groups and educational initiatives relating to ecology\
  \ and technology. Many visitors and potential DAO participants will have little\
  \ experience with blockchain and Web3 — and will interact and be exposed to Gnosis\
  \ Chain and ecosystem for the first time. Through a special statute and voting mechanism\
  \ of the association which locks the ownership in the DAO, it also serves as a permanent\
  \ protector of the piece of land against disposal and reintegration into economic\
  \ dependence and exploitation.\n\nDuring the production period and exhibition terra0\
  \ and LAS will host a series of workshops and events to on-board and orient the\
  \ community into the DAO. Gnosis DAO will receive a proportional amount of tokens\
  \ relative to the proposed funding to participate in the terra0 land art project\
  \ — one that we see as a key member when engaging in a long-term project about the\
  \ evolution of legal structures pertaining to DAOs and ecological management.\n\n\
  The exhibition component of the terra0 land art project will be exhibited with LAS.\
  \ Previous exhibitions produced by LAS can be viewed here 1. In recent exhibitions,\
  \ LAS received approximately 25 000 – 30 000 visitors for the duration, an average\
  \ of 600-800 visitors a day. Additional coverage of 60 – 100 media outlets enabled\
  \ the exhibition’s themes to be brought to the forefront of international discourse.\n\
  \nFor the land art project to be successful, the DAO requires a legal structure\
  \ to hold and administer property (land) according to German law. We are currently\
  \ working with legal teams to define a Gnosis Safe as the managing tool for a Verein\
  \ under German jurisdiction. This framework will allow for the fluid recognition\
  \ of token holders (as addresses) to be viewed as legal members of an organization\
  \ at the time of voting without any additional registration.\n\n####  Two aspects\
  \ are to be particularly emphasized:\n1. The legal membership in the Verein will\
  \ be defined only by a membership token, the associated address, and will not require\
  \ the registration of identity through KYC (with the exception of seven registered\
  \ members, which is a condition for each Verein in Germany).\n\n2. Votes which take\
  \ place with the help of the associated voting methods (such as Governor mod) to\
  \ be legally defined by the association rules as “continuous association meetings.”\n\
  \nIf these two aspects are laid out in an association regulation, the Gnosis Safe\
  \ can be legally integrated into a Verein without any additional infrastructure.\
  \ The development period will be followed by an initial implementation and prototype\
  \ of this legal structure that will be deployed as the framework for the DAO in\
  \ conjunction with the land art project and exhibition.\n\nFollowing this, terra0\
  \ will create a web and Gnosis Safe app (this could take the form as something similar\
  \ to KALI with increased functionality) with a DAO template engine that will allow\
  \ and enable a DAO to be incorporated under German law as a Verein. The app will\
  \ facilitate the deployment of a Gnosis Safe, create the legal documents required\
  \ for the registration of the Verein under German law, and will use the Gnosis Safe\
  \ and associated voting method.\n\n## Milestones & timeline\n### 2023\n- May–June:\
