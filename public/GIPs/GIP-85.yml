  \ to support Covalent as initially mentioned in GIP 16\n    author: Ryan Coree @coreeryan\
  \ & David Tso @davidtsocy \n    status: Draft\n    type: Funding\n    created: 2023-04-19\n\
  \    funding: 50,000 USD\n    \n\nDear GnosisDAO,\n\nCovalent is a hosted blockchain\
  \ data solution providing access to full historical and current onchain data for\
  \ 100+ supported chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base,\
  \ Linea, Scroll, Avalanche, Fantom, and more.\n\nCovalent Offers 2 Products\n\n\
  \  1. Unified API: Covalent’s industry-leading Unified API is the most robust set\
  \ of API services available on the market today. Our Unified API returns enriched\
  \ blockchain data applicable to all blockchain networks, e.g. token balances, transactions,\
  \ log events, etc., enabling developers to build wallet applications like Rainbow\
  \ Wallet, NFT galleries like NFTX, investor dashboards like CoinGecko, and taxation\
  \ tools like Rotki. Over 3,000 applications and 35,000 active developers today rely\
  \ on our Unified API, powering half a billion monthly API calls.\n  2. Increment:\
  \ Increment is a Business Intelligence (BI) platform that empowers blockchain-based\
  \ projects to understand their business metrics. Built on our Unified API, Increment\
  \ has the full historical data set for over 100 chains. Increment is imbued with\
  \ a standardized analytics framework – Reach (for growing a user base), Retention\
  \ (for retaining a user base), and Revenue (for monetizing a user base). Increment\
  \ also contains many more label tables for NFTs and DeFi.\n\n\n\nProposal\n\n  *\
  \ As previously proposed in GIP 16 - Gnosis Chain - xDAI/Gnosis merge by Martin\
  \ Köppelmann, the Co-Founder of Gnosis: “Gnosis Chain will look to attract core\
  \ Ethereum infrastructure projects that are currently unavailable on the xDai chain.\
  \ Gnosis Chain will cover the costs associated with such deployments. Examples include\
  \ Etherscan, Beaconcha.in, Infura, Alchemy, Covalent…”\n  * Covalent will index\
  \ Gnosis and integrate it with our Unified API and Increment for a compensation\
  \ of 50,000 USD, this will benefit developers and analysts who want to access Gnosis’\
  \ data.\n  * Covalent will also create custom documentation for Gnosis and run a\
  \ technical webinar for the Gnosis community to onboard more developers and kickstart\
  \ novel use cases.\n\n\n\nCovalent Deliverables\n\n  1. Index Gnosis’ public blockchain\
  \ and support it through our Unified API and Increment\n  2. Dedicated documentation\
  \ page for developers\n  3. Prominent Gnosis logo on Covalent’s website\n  4. Emails\
  \ and relevant notifications to Covalent’s user base\n  5. Promotion of launch across\
  \ social media handles, Discord groups, Telegram, etc.\n\n\n\nGnosis Deliverables\n\
  \n  1. Vote for governance proposal\n  2. A joint social media announcement post-integration\n\
  \  3. Inclusion of Covalent’s logo in Gnosis’ marketing materials, website, and\
  \ documentation\n\n\n\nThe end date will be one year from the agreement’s effective\
  \ date. The agreement may be extended based on mutual discussions between relevant\
  \ parties.\n\nGrant and Disbursement\n\n  * The amount to be funded from the GnosisDAO\
  \ treasury to Covalent is 50,000 USD of Gnosis’ xDai native token. Once the governance\
  \ proposal is approved, the payment will be processed as one single transfer.\n\
  \  * The xDai/USD exchange rate for the disbursements is to be determined at the\
  \ time of the transfer.\n\n\n\nTestimonials\n\n“So far, Covalent has significantly\
  \ enhanced the developer experience on Fantom via their Unified API. It will no\
  \ doubt be a staple in how users access blockchain data.”\n\n– Michael Kong, CEO\
  \ at Fantom\n\n“Decentralized applications and services need fast and reliable access\
  \ to backend data to deliver seamless experiences competitive with Web 2.0. With\
  \ its Unified API for data across multiple chains, Covalent is well-positioned to\
  \ support the march toward mass adoption of Web3.”\n\n– John Nahas, SVP of Business\
  \ Development at Avalanche\n\n“Broader Web3 adoption requires great application\
  \ UX and performant access to backend data, but these have historically been constrained\
  \ by what the direct node RPCs are able to offer. Covalent’s unique approach not\
  \ only delivers performance but also access to an enriched multi-chain data set\
  \ via their Unified API. It’s a great fit for Moonbeam developers looking to create\
  \ next-generation multi-chain applications.”\n\n– Derek Yoo, CEO at Moonbeam\n\n\
  Conclusion\n\nThe Covalent team hopes that the GnosisDAO can see the value of this\
  \ partnership and pledge their support. Thank you!\n"
