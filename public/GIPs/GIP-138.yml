title: Should Gnosis DAO fund the maintenance of NodeSentinel?
body: "# Summary\nNodeSentinel is a validator monitoring tool for Gnosis beacon validators,\
  \ built with an indexer + UI (Telegram bot + web).\n\n## Main features\n- Dashboard\
  \ with performance stats, CL+EL APY across timeframes  \n- Alerting system  \n-\
  \ Subsidized claimable rewards  \n\nThe tool has been live for 2 years at NodeSentinel’s\
  \ cost and is already used for free across the validator set.  \n\n## Proposal contingent\
  \ on\n- Keeping the service running and improving infrastructure  \n- Monthly status\
  \ reports  \n- Shipping the proposed roadmap and open-sourcing the code  \n- Year-1\
  \ renewal gate tied to delivery  \n\n## Funds requested\n- **35,000 DAI (retroactive)**\
  \  \n- **3,000 GNO staked:** rewards fund operations while DAO keeps the principal\
  \  \n\n## Budget model\n- 35,000 DAI retroactive payment  \n- Forward maintenance\
  \ via staking 3,000 GNO in a StakeWise vault with 100% fee on rewards (principal\
  \ remains DAO-owned)  \n- Est. ~8% APY → ~240 GNO/year (~$36.6k at $140 avg, variable)\
  \  \n- Auto-renews yearly, cancellable at any time  \n- Biannual check-ins with\
  \ the team  \n\n## Adoption signal\n- 94 active operators  \n- Monitoring ~60,249\
  \ validators (>19% of the total network)  \n- 650 subsidized claims  \n\n## Why\
  \ FOR\n- Improves infrastructure to onboard more users  \n- Develops the proposed\
  \ roadmap with new features and UX improvements  (details in forum discussion)\n\
  - Rewards-funded model aligns incentives, limits stablecoin outflows, and keeps\
  \ GNO with the DAO  \n- Provides an alternative to other monitoring tools, reducing\
  \ single-vendor risk  \n\n## Conditions before renewal\n1. **Monthly public metrics:**\
  \ active operators, validators monitored, alerts sent, alert accuracy, service uptime/SLA,\
  \ subsidized claims. Starts first full month after approval.  \n2. **Open-source\
  \ milestones (Year-1):** publish beacon indexer + API with docs, then bot and web\
  \ dashboard components. Repositories under [github.com/NodeSentinel](https://github.com/NodeSentinel),\
  \ updates posted on the forum.  \n3. **Year-1 renewal gate:** rewards-funded model\
  \ continues only if (1) and (2) are met. Otherwise, DAO may cancel or revise the\
  \ stake at renewal.\n\nNodeSentinel address\n safe=gno:0xDA74B77BA4BE36619b248088214D807A581292C4"
