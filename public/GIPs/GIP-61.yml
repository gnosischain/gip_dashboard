title: Shall GnosisDAO fund BootNode as a Core Contributor Team?
body: "## Simple Summary\n\nBootNode proposes to contribute engineering and development\
  \ services to the Gnosis DAO ecosystem by building a hands-on autonomous team with\
  \ relevant experience in multiple disciplines that will focus on growing the GC\
  \ ecosystem adoption, starting with the following priorities:\n\n* Further strengthening\
  \ and decentralizing the DAO development by incorporating an additional specialized\
  \ Contributor Team working towards a shared goal.\n* Bridges operation: product\
  \ discovery, development, coordination, and engineering to count with an up-to-date\
  \ and sustainable Bridges operation: present infrastructure and future initiatives.\n\
  * Circles: build the required infrastructure so many teams ideally can bring a wave\
  \ of new users to the gnosis chain.\n* Gnosis Chain decentralization and security:\
  \ running chain, beacon chain, and bridges nodes.\n* Other initiatives the DAO might\
  \ need.\n\nThe team will commit long-term by starting with a 6-month engagement.\n\
  \n## Motivation\n\nSince the early days, many BootNode (BN) team members have contributed\
  \ to the Gnosis ecosystem by being exposed to different projects:\n\n* POA Network:\
  \ creating the required infrastructure used later to build xDAI.\n* Gnosis Chain\
  \ (formerly xDAI): from bootstrapping the network and being core contributors to\
  \ different bridges and dApps, to educating, onboarding new projects, and consulting.\n\
  * Core contributors to the Circles infrastructure.\n* Core contributors to the Gnosis\
  \ Safe (BN became a Safe Guardian) and other projects such as Auctions, COW Protocol,\
  \ Omen, and dxDAO.\n\nWe believe that the Gnosis DAO will benefit from the value\
  \ BootNode can add due to its outstanding team and relevant experience. BootNode\
  \ accelerates the building and growth of protocols, dApps, and networks through\
  \ engineering, development, and governance.\n\nWe are confident we can work productively\
  \ alongside the Gnosis DAO on different projects. We will push growth forward of\
  \ the Circles, the Gnosis Chain, and other initiatives.\n\nAt BootNode, we share\
  \ a vision to build a decentralized organization and network with a decentralized\
  \ ecosystem of contributors. We strongly believe in a positive sum game for Gnosis\
  \ DAO, where many protocol developers, web2 and web3 builders, infrastructure participants,\
  \ researchers, and community members can work together.\n\n## Specification\n\n\
  The following items are the initial areas of contribution. However, they might change\
  \ if they are no longer needed or if there are other initiatives where BootNode\
  \ can provide higher value.\n\n### 1: Bridges\n\nThe team will work closely with\
  \ all the involved parties to maintain and improve the bridge solutions that empower\
  \ the Gnosis Chain (the native bridges [OmniBridge](https://omni.gnosischain.com/bridge)\
  \ and [xDAI Bridge](https://bridge.gnosischain.com/) as well as other solutions\
  \ such as [Connext Bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/) and [Hop Exchange](https://hopapp.exchange/)).\
  \ Also, it will work on a new bridge that will consolidate existing options in one\
  \ place. Last but not lease, we will contribute to the research and development\
  \ of the trustless bridge already in progress.\n\nMilestones can change once the\
  \ revised roadmap is discovered and created.\n\nMilestone #0\n\n* Goal: create a\
  \ comprehensive roadmap and kick-off onboarding\n* Tasks\n  * Refine scope of work\
  \ and iterate over a roadmap\n  * Define communication processes (roles, channels,\
  \ etc.)\n  * Defile roles, assign responsibilities and allocate resources and team.\n\
  \  * Define specific milestones, timelines, and deliverables.\n* Deliverables\n\
  \  * A detailed roadmap with milestones, timelines, and action items.\n  * A document\
  \ that defines the processes, workflows, and methodologies.\n* Outcomes\n  * Stakeholders\
  \ agree on the roadmap.\n  * The team has a refined execution plan.\n  * A team\
  \ with the required skills is allocated to deliver the results according to the\
  \ roadmap.\n  * Kick-off date for starting executing the roadmap.\n\nMilestone #1\n\
  \n* Goal: Maintenance and operational management\n* Tasks\n  * Improve financial\
  \ operations of the bridges.\n    * Native Bridges (Omni + xDAI).\n    * Non-native\
  \ bridges (Connext + Hop).\n  * Identify liquidity management needs on other bridging\
  \ solutions such as Hop and Connext.\n  * Develop monitoring tools and dashboards\
  \ to measure financial performance easily. (this one can be used as a starting point:\
  \ https://dune.com/maxaleks/Compounding-in-xDai-bridges )\n  * Improve observability\
  \ and monitoring of the bridge's infrastructure.\n  * Live Monitoring application\
  \ that shows transaction status for each validator and can monitor transactions\
  \ in both directions. (this can be used as a starting point: https://docs.tokenbridge.net/about-tokenbridge/components/amb-live-monitoring-application\
  \ )\n  * Increase decentralization and scalability of both native and non-native\
  \ bridges.\n  * Identify routers’ and validators’ maintenance needs.\n  * Communicate\

  \ for measuring bridge's financial performance.\n  * Documented architecture of\
  \ infrastructure, pipelines, and technical workflows.\n  * Reporting about bridge\
  \ usage, costs, and revenues associated with bridges.\n  * Communicate additional\
  \ capabilities of Omnibridge to developers.\n  * List of financial KPI to keep track\
  \ of.\n  * P&L reporting.\n* Outcomes\n  * Better financial control, visibility,\
  \ and transparency of bridge operations.\n  * Operation improvements reduce manual\
  \ and reactive work that leads to slow, unproductive, and error-prone issues.\n\n\
  Milestone #2\n\n* Goal: Consolidate Omni + xDAI UIs\n* Tasks\n  * Create UX wireframes\
  \ for a consolidated UI.\n  * Create the front-end and UIs.\n  * If needed, refactor\
  \ Omni bridges and xDAI bridge backends and infrastructure to easily make the UI\
  \ merge.\n* Deliverables\n  * A repository with the new consolidated UI.\n  * New\
  \ UI is deployed.\n* Outcomes\n  * UX is improved, aiming for fewer dropouts.\n\
  \  * Facilitate bridging operations into Gnosis Chain by a fairly simple process.\n\
  \nMilestone #3\n\n* Goal: Security assessment plan and evaluation of bridges operation\
  \ and infrastructure.\n* Tasks\n  * Evaluate the current security (web2 and web3).\n\
  \  * Define a security plan and action items to improve the security of the bridges.\n\
  * Deliverables\n  * A document that describes the security assessment.\n  * A detailed\
  \ security roadmap and best practices to follow.\n* Outcomes\n  * Improved awareness\
  \ of the current security.\n  * Increased security of the operation and infrastructure.\n\
  \  * Reduced risks associated with possible security breaches (web2 and web3).\n\
  \nMilestone #4\n\n* Goal: Evaluate options for native bridges to bridge to other\
  \ networks (today, only mainnet is supported).\n* Tasks\n  * Analyze and research\
  \ the needs and motivations to do it natively versus using/integrating with 3rd\
  \ party solutions.\n  * Research and evaluate technical improvements and enhancements\
  \ according to the research.\n* Deliverables\n  * A technical plan for enabling\
  \ users to easily bridge to as many networks as possible.\n  * Submit GIPs according\
  \ to research.\n* Outcomes\n  * The needs of assets bridging of users and protocols\
  \ are clearly defined.\n  * Everyone can provide feedback on the future steps.\n\
  \nMilestone #5 (might change the priority to be done sooner)\n\n* Goal: discovery\
  \ phase to build a Bridge Aggregator.\n* Tasks\n  * Evaluate building a consolidated\
  \ app that helps users to bridge assets from all kinds of chains to GC using any\
  \ supported solution (could be a combination of Li.finance, xDAI, Omnibridge, Connext,\
  \ Hop, and other options).\n  * Identify technical and business requirements.\n\
  \  * Create a Product Specifications Document.\n  * Create a roadmap with milestones,\
  \ timelines, effort estimates, etc.\n* Deliverables\n  * Evaluation result: Go /\
  \ No Go.\n  * Product Specifications Document.\n  * Product Development Plan.\n\
  * Outcomes\n  * Stakeholders understand if such a product is needed and its value\
  \ to the ecosystem.\n  * The team has complete visibility on what needs to be built.\n\
  \nMilestones #6 and beyond: TBD\n\n### 2: Circles infrastructure\n\nWhen referring\
  \ to Circles Infrastructure, the Circle UBI project has been lacking continuity\
  \ of a development team, therefore, making the product roadmap hard to plan as every\
  \ milestone relies on software development. As a result, the enormous potential\
  \ of this ecosystem is not being fully realized. However, we could envision a possible\
  \ roadmap:\n\n* Contribution to user-friendly frontends, including Circles.Land\
  \ and Gnosis Safe.\n* Backends / Subgraphs\n* Monitoring\n* Dashboards\n* SDKs\n\
  * Tech support to other teams building on Circles infrastructure\n* Contribute onboarding\
  \ DAOs to benefit from Circles features.\n\nRoadmap: it is currently under development\
  \ being built by several parties. To be published soon.\n\nScope of Work: Bootnode's\
  \ team has already been working on this initiative as an ongoing project since May\
  \ 2022, contributing with: back-end, front-end, QA, UI, and Project Management.\n\
  \nAs an outcome of this proposal, we expect to maximize the overall Circles UBI\
  \ growth.\n\nThe ecosystem will initially benefit as follows:\n\n* Circles users\
  \ (individuals and DAOs): will enjoy new features, improved reliability, and great\
  \ UX.\n* Gnosis DAO: additional level of certainty in fulfilling the Circles UBI\
  \ vision.\n* Projects building on top of Circles; core infrastructure:\n  * Public\
  \ roadmap with the features the team will implement in the future.\n  * Access to\
  \ propose and prioritize feature requests.\n* Gnosis Chain: higher block utilization\
  \ due to the expected growth of the Circles protocol.\n\n### 3: Gnosis Beacon Chain\
  \ decentralization and security\n\nBootNode will setup and run the Gnosis Chain\
  \ full-stack (validator nodes and bridges) focusing on the Gnosis Beacon Chain and\
  \ its path to the merge contributing to making it happen before Main net.\n\nRoadmap:\
  \ [https://evening-lake-61d.notion.site/Gnosis-beacon-chain-merge-ca7e8759e5094b18accdc077e4959315](https://evening-lake-61d.notion.site/Gnosis-beacon-chain-merge-ca7e8759e5094b18accdc07)\n\
  \n### 4: Gnosis DAO growth\n\nWe believe that by relying on a long-term committed\
  \ engineering team, GnosisDAO ecosystem will be able to work on a more sound, clear,\
  \ and executable vision, considerably increasing the probability of hitting every\
  \ milestone in the roadmap. Therefore, many other Gnosis ecosystem’s efforts can\
  \ count on the outcomes produced by this team:\n\n* Support community development\
  \ and education about Gnosis Chain, Bridges, and Circle UBI.\n* Be available for\
  \ different potential needs of the DAO and the community.\n* Support research, create,\
  \ and deliver new proposals within GIPs and expand Gnosis Chain to other ecosystems\
  \ (protocols, networks, infrastructures, etc.).\n* Protocol smart contracts development\
  \ and GIP support.\n* Attend technical conferences and Gnosis DAO events to support\
  \ growth.\n* Support pair programming sessions and education with dApp teams to\
  \ share best practices and one-on-one support.\n* Bootstrap, run, and manage Gnosis\
  \ Beacon Chan and Gnosis Chain validators aligning long-term via GNO incentives.\n\
  \n### Team\n\nBootNode excellence in delivering an outstanding contribution and\
  \ thinking outside the box is leveraged by already existing characteristics that\
  \ have been poolish as a result of a team with an average of 10+ years of experience\
  \ building and shipping software for many industries and 5+ years for the EVM ecosystem\
  \ in particular.\n\nWe have identified the right candidates to build a **6 to 8\
  \ members cross-functional and autonomous team (a Squad)** with all the required\
  \ skills to work on the proposed scope of work, contribute to the network roadmap,\
  \ and other potential work valuable to the chain.\n\nSome team members have participated\
  \ in designing and developing the two existing native bridges (OmniBridge and xDai\
  \ Bridge) and have worked with other cross-chain projects contributing to the core\
  \ protocol and integrations, such as Connext Network. Also, part of the team has\
  \ been contributing to building the Circle infrastructure developing a “Group Currency”\
  \ layer on top of Circles for a couple of months and is fully knowledgeable about\
  \ it.\n\nBootNode’s track record of experience in the field provides a competitive\
  \ advantage to the GC that could speed the solution, derisk the DAO, and meet expectations.\n\
  \n### Progress status\n\n* Bi-monthly progress reports in the forum.\n* Participation\
  \ in the community calls.\n* Discord channels.\n* Roadmap, backlog, prioritization\
  \ discussions, etc. are transparent and visible in notion, GitHub, and any other\
  \ tool consistent with the other teams.\n\n### Terms of the Agreement\n\n* Time\
  \ horizon: 6 months (closer to the end, a follow-on proposal will be created).\n\
  * Amount: $580k in DAI or USDC.\n* GNO: 580 GNO (exclusively for running GBC validators\
  \ for at least 12 months).\n* Safe address in main net: eth:0x3bCba50Ec74d18c583e0A832DD19AE37E9348790\n\
  \n### Duration and Termination\n\n* This proposal shall come into force and be binding\
  \ upon the Parties from the date the proposal is approved by the GnosisDAO governance\
  \ mechanism.\n* The GnosisDAO may terminate BootNode’s engagement under this agreement\
  \ for any reason by Governance Mechanism upon a 30-day notice as a new discussion\
  \ thread in the GnosisDAO forum.\n* BootNode may terminate this agreement upon a\
  \ 30-day notice as a new discussion thread in the GnosisDAO forum.\n* Without previous\
  \ notification, BN will be entitled to terminate this agreement if GnosisDAO fails\
  \ to make payments for more than 2 consecutive periods.\n\n# About BootNode\n\n\
