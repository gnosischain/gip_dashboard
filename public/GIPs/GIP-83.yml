title: Should GnosisDAO fund decentralized alternatives of Gnosis Chain pruned and
  archival RPC endpoints from Pocket Network f

  \ \n\nService Agreement for Decentralized RPC Access of Gnosis Chain through the\
  \ Pocket Network protocol\n\nCategory\n\nService Agreements - Decentralized Gnosis\
  \ Chain Public RPCs powered by Pocket Network\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nPocket Network\
  \ is a decentralized, middleware protocol focused on the RPC layer. Its goal is\
  \ to provide blockchain application developers with a privacy-preserving, multi-chain\
  \ gateway on top of the Pocket Network protocol that allows dapp developers to mint\
  \ reliable, fast RPC endpoints for the 40+ blockchain networks supported, including\
  \ both Gnosis Chain pruned and Gnosis Chain archival.\n\nFor example, over the last\
  \ month, Gnosis Chain has carved the number 3 spot in terms of requests per day\
  \ at ~130.6M daily average requests through Pocket Network according to POKTscan!\n\
  \nAfter speaking with stakeholders on both sides of the aisle, Pocket Network Inc\
  \ has been encouraged to publish this new Gnosis Improvement Proposal without the\
  \ retroactive funding aspect. The previous years of service are a gift to the Gnosis\
  \ community of users, developers, applications, and protocols. Thank you for the\
  \ opportunity to demonstrate Pocket Network’s value proposition as the most redundant,\
  \ reliable, multi-chain RPC layer by taking on additional traffic during Dark Forest\
  \ rounds and the xDAI to Gnosis Chain transition (to name a few past examples).\n\
  \nGnosis and Pocket stakeholders favor an 18-month service contract to fund continued\
  \ access to decentralized RPC alternatives for both Gnosis Chain pruned and Gnosis\
  \ Chain archival. It will allow GnosisDAO to steward this public good together with\
  \ Pocket Network!\n\nBy funding a pokt-powered Public Gnosis Chain RPC endpoint,\
  \ GnosisDAO and Pocket Network would continue to contribute to the decentralization,\
  \ increased resiliency, and censorship-resistance of the Gnosis Chain network. All\
  \ the while, continuing to incentivize Gnosis Chain node runners with $POKT tokens\
  \ for serving Gnosis dapps.\n\nService Description\n\nPocket Network Inc. staked\
  \ POKT on behalf of the GnosisDAO to subsidize a public good in the form of public\
  \ RPC endpoints (available in the Gnosis Chain docs) without rate limits:\n\n1.\
  \ https://gnosischain-rpc.gateway.pokt.network/\n2. https://gnosischain-archival-rpc.gateway.pokt.network/\n\
  \nThe current set of Gnosis Relay Chain IDs (RCIs) Pocket Network supports are:\n\
  \n1. Gnosis Chain pruned = 0027 (mainnet)\n2. Gnosis Chain archival = 000C (mainnet)\n\
  \nThe POKTdao allowlisted Gnosis Chain (0027) on 07/06/21, with Gnosis Chain Archival\
  \ (000C) shortly after on 08/26/21).\n\nSince the allowlist date, Pocket node operators\
  \ earned 55.6M POKT from servicing over 38.9B Gnosis Chain mainnet read/write requests.\
  \ See this spreadsheet for a breakdown of relays drive and POKT earned.\n\nOver\
  \ that time, these Gnosis RCIs developed to become one of the more populated, stable,\
  \ and higher-performant pools of nodes. Pocket’s network of node runners easily\
  \ handled several spikes, including a big spike to 243.6M requests on a single day\
  \ recently in JAN 2023.\n\nOver the last year or so, Pocket Network has been serving\
  \ 100M+ requests per day with an excellent average response time of ~150ms with\
  \ success rates above 99% across all Pocket Portal regions. Moreso, in the Asia-Pacific\
  \ region (most used region by Gnosis) the response times are as low as 40ms (lower\
  \ = better & faster).\n \n![gip83 regions.png](ipfs://bafkreiff3yj5qgk2fk36gikhd33ep5rwmix2e2qipdw7eugx57wdnv3nm4)\n\
  \    \nAccording to POKTscan, there are currently 20,596 Pocket Service Nodes pointing\
  \ to Gnosis Full Nodes for the 0027 Relay Chain ID and 2,695 Pocket Service Nodes\
  \ pointing to Gnosis Archive Nodes for the 000C Relay Chain ID.\n\nThis demonstrates\
  \ the POKT node incentives at work!\n\nThe POKTdao has also supported node deployment\
  \ solutions through funding grants such as Node Pilot and DappNode to make it super\
  \ easy to spin up and monetize Gnosis full/archival nodes within the Pocket Network\
  \ protocol.\n\nService Scope and Service Delivery\n\nPocket Network agrees to these\
  \ milestones and deliverables:\n \n![gip83 milestones and deliverables.PNG](ipfs://bafkreiepfbfuhoyabcev64xp65pgiwo6v5th5f5hsctijf276xwl53mlbq)\n\
  \    \nSupport\n\nThe GnosisDAO will be able to monitor and manage the public RPCs\
  \ through our Pocket Portal as they see fit, including the ability to enable additional\
  \ security features such as allowlisting user-agents, origins, smart contracts,\
  \ and methods.\n \n![gip83 portal security settings.png](ipfs://bafkreie2bbe6fiz6ykrjppbgac2sfwyznna53svdjf2rrmg764cn5n54km)\n\
  \    \nThe GnosisDAO and Gnosis Chain users are able to submit support tickets through\
  \ this link.\n\nPricing and Payment\n\nPocket Network has simplified their model\
  \ this year to mirror a traditional SaaS-like tiered structure, which is much more\
  \ affordable. To sweeten the deal, Pocket is offering the Gnosis DAO team and community\
  \ a massive discount on a 150M requests per day at $0.0000020 throughput an 18-month\
  \ commitment with the option to renew:\n\n$164,250 USD for 150M Requests Per Day\
  \ on a 18-month contract\n\nThat represents 3.65x in yearly savings (a 365% discount)\
  \ compared to the original offer!\n\nPayment Schedule\t\nPayment Dates\tAmount Due\n\
  Upon Proposal Passing (50%) = $82,125 USD\nUpon Milestone Completion (50%) = $82,125\
  \ USD\nTotal (100%) = $164,250 USD\n\nPNI prefers payment in stablecoins, such as\
  \ USDC or DAI, at this provided address from Pocket Network, Inc. → 0x5F1Feefc4BB7a414096cCF070BeEF94da8Ff88A6\n\
  \nIn case a buffer is wanted/needed, as traffic continues to grow, PNI would like\
  \ to extend another option to purchase additional bandwidth at the discounted price\
  \ of $0.0000018640 per request throughout the contract period.\n\nIf Pocket Network\
  \ Inc is unsuccessful in their proposal to secure funding, PNI will continue to\
  \ support the Gnosis Chain network; however, in an effort to do so sustainably,\
  \ PNI would introduce per-second rate limits on the Public RPC that would channel\
  \ users and developers to a paid tier in the Pocket Portal where costs would be\
  \ passed on directly to Gnosis builders/users outside the free tier of 250k requests\
  \ per day.\n\nService Terms and Exit Strategy\n\nContact the sales team at Pocket\

  https://twitter.com/POKTnetwork\n\nConclusion\n\nA decentralized RPC protocol is\
  \ crucial for a blockchain that values decentralization such as Gnosis Chain.\n\n\
  Public RPCs are a public good, Pocket Network hopes to share in the responsibility\
  \ together with the GnosisDAO of maintaining these high-quality public goods on\
  \ behalf of Gnosis Chain users. The Pocket Network team and community have been\
  \ a long-time supporters of the Gnosis Chain.\n\nWe’re proud to continue supporting\
  \ Gnosis!"
