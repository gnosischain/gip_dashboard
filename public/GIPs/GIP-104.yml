  title: Grant for Marketing Activities: Enhance Awareness and Adoption of Shutterized
  Gnosis Chain

  author: brainbot gmbh

  status: Proposed

  type: Funding

  created: 2024-06-17


  duration: 6 months

  funding: 40,000 xDAI + 100 GNO



  ## Executive Summary


  brainbot seeks a grant of 40,000 xDAI + 100 GNO from Gnosis DAO to expand our marketing
  campaign in support of the launch of Shutterized Gnosis Chain. Our goal is to amplify
  awareness of Shutterized Gnosis Chain and its benefits to end users - protection
  against malicious MEV and censorship. Our intended impact is to achieve widespread
  adoption - increase users and transactions on Shutterized Gnosis Chain. The two
  primary foci of these marketing activities will be 1) to hire and direct Wachsman,
  a PR agency to promote the launch and all activities around it and 2) to put a heavy
  focus on IRL events such as ETHCC, hackathons and various meetups.


  The activities under this grant will run through Q3 and Q4 2024.


  ## Specification


  **Opportunity:**


  Gnosis Chain, Nethermind and brainbot recently announced the [launch of Shutterized
  Chiado testnet](https://blog.shutter.network/the-first-shutterized-testnet-is-now-live-on-chiado/).
  We are now working together to launch Shutterized Gnosis Chain in early July 2024.


  Shutterized Gnosis Chain will be a significant milestone for a Gnosis Chain and
  its users. Gnosis Chain will become the first blockchain to implement threshold
  encrypted mempools, which protect end users against malicious MEV and censorship
  using decentralized technology.


  **Initiative:**


  brainbot is spearheading a comprehensive marketing campaign to ensure a successful
  launch of Shutterized Gnosis Chain. The campaign aims to:


  - further promote Gnosis Chain as the leading blockchain implementing crypto’s core
  values: decentralization, permissionlessness, accessibility, information symmetry
  etc.


  - highlight Gnosis Chain’s growing DeFi ecosystem


  - raise awareness that Gnosis Chain is now the “safe blockchain”, where degens can
  trade without fear of malicious MEV (such as front running and sandwich attacks)

  - raise awareness that Gnosis Chain is also the “censorship resistant blockchain”,
  where users can be assured that their transactions are a) included, b) treated equally
  and fairly regardless of their content


  - increase the satisfaction / NPS of defi traders on Gnosis Chain


  - increase the percentage of protected transactions on Gnosis Chain


  - growth in social media engagement and followers (Gnosis Chain and Shutter accounts)


  - achieve media coverage for the launch of Shutterized Gnosis Chain


  Stretch goals:


  - increase the total number of users and total value locked (TVL) on Gnosis Chain


  - increase the total number of monthly transactions on Gnosis Chain

  The marketing campaign will increase awareness of the benefits to end users (e.g.
  protection against malicious MEV and censorship) and achieve widespread adoption
  (e.g. increase users and transactions on Shutterized Gnosis Chain). The proposed
  grant will benefit Gnosis Chain and the Gnosis ecosystem.
