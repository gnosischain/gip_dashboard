title: GIP-128 Should GnosisDAO fund Gnosis Ltd with $30m/ year? - Governance - Gnosis
body: "## Summary\n\nThis proposal requests a grant with an annual budget of **$30\
  \ million in stablecoins** , disbursed **quarterly** , to fund the operations of\
  \ Gnosis Ltd — now formally a quasi-foundation — as the primary builder of Gnosis\
  \ infrastructure and ecosystem products.\n\nGnosis Ltd played a foundational role\
  \ in the Gnosis ecosystem: it conducted the original **GNO token sale** in 2017,\
  \ and in 2021, divested **150k ETH, 8 million GNO** , and several third-party token\
  \ positions into the newly formed **GnosisDAO**. Since then, it has operated without\
  \ requesting funding, relying on its retained assets.\n\nAs of early 2025, Gnosis\
  \ Ltd has successfully completed its legal transformation into a quasi **foundation**\
  \ (a Company Ltd by guarantee without share capital), eliminating the dual equity-token\
  \ structure and converting the entity into a purely purpose driven organization,\
  \ with the objective to further the Gnosis ecosystem and decentralised technologies\
  \ more generally. With the transition complete and reserves running low, this proposal\
  \ marks its **first funding request to the DAO**.\n\nWhile many entities contribute,\
  \ Gnosis Ltd is still the primary development and operations entity in the Gnosis\
  \ ecosystem. It builds and maintains the core infrastructure that powers Gnosis\
  \ Chain, and develops and supports major products, onboarding, BD, and governance\
  \ tooling for the community.\n\nThis proposal ensures continuity and momentum for\
  \ critical initiatives, while maintaining full alignment with the DAO’s long-term\
  \ interests.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe’re proposing an important change in how we position\
  \ Gnosis. Going forward, Gnosis would become a core consumer-facing brand, rooted\
  \ in integrity, trusted execution, and user agency. The story we want to tell is\
  \ no longer just about open infrastructure, but about **building fair, user-owned\
  \ financial systems**.\n\nWe believe we can gain stronger traction by fully committing\
  \ to our most compelling narrative, rather than trying to be everything at once.\
  \ We now have all the key components in place, and bringing them together under\
  \ one cohesive brand will not only clarify our message but also strengthen the platforms\
  \ that power it.\n\nWe propose renaming the Metri app to Gnosis. It would become\
  \ the central retail interface to everything we build. All core offerings — Gnosis\
  \ [i.e., the wallet], HQ, Gnosis Chain, and Gnosis Pay — would live under the Gnosis\
  \ domain and share a unified brand identity. Only Circles retains its own branding\
  \ and domain, while continuing to operate on Gnosis Chain as a core ecosystem project.\n\
  \nThis structure is loosely reflected in the placeholder landing mockup we created\
  \ to illustrate its potential appearance. In that concept:\n\nPersonal → Wallet\
  \ (fka Metri)  \nBusiness → Gnosis HQ  \nPlatform → A foldout menu linking to Gnosis\
  \ Chain, Gnosis Pay, Circles  \nCollective → A foldout menu to Gnosis Labs, Gnosis\
  \ VC, Treasury, Forum, Blog, Newsletter\n\n![imageimage2560×1560 542 KB]( \"image\"\
  )\n\nGnosis Chain remains the foundational platform: resilient, credibly neutral,\
  \ and deeply integrated with local stablecoins and payment rails. Gnosis Pay enables\
  \ on-chain assets in self-custody to be used in everyday payments. It operates B2B\
  \ and powers apps like Gnosis, Zeal, and Picnic. **GNO is the unifying asset across\
  \ all these efforts** — value creation accrues to GNO. **There will be no further\
  \ spinoffs.**\n\n## Scope of Work & Budget Breakdown\n\nThe requested grant will\
  \ cover Gnosis Ltd’s forecasted expenditure for a 12-month period, starting July\
  \ 1, 2025. Disbursements will occur quarterly, with each installment totaling **$7.5M\
  \ in stablecoins**. Funds will be sent to Gnosis Ltd’s Gnosis Safe.\n\nBelow is\
  \ a high-level breakdown of Gnosis Ltd’s budget for the next 12 months. There are\
  \ currently 127 team members and we’re expecting to onboard 25 more in the coming\
  \ year.\n\n**Product Development** | **$15.5m**  \n---|---  \nGnosis Pay | $8.0m\

  \n  * Gnosis Ltd will publish **quarterly reports** detailing spend and progress\
  \ across all budget categories.\n\n  * No additional oversight structures are proposed;\
  \ DAO token holders retain ultimate accountability through governance.\n\n  * Future\
  \ funding will depend on DAO review of outcomes and updated proposals.\n\n\n\n\n\
  ## Closing Note\n\nGnosis Ltd seeded the DAO. This proposal ensures the DAO can\
  \ continue to rely on it. Onwards and upwards! !:rocket:\n\n11 Likes\n"
