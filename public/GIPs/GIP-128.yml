title: GIP-128 Should GnosisDAO fund Gnosis Ltd with $30m/ year?
body: "This proposal requests a grant with an annual budget of $30 million in stablecoins,\
  \ disbursed quarterly, to fund the operations of Gnosis Ltd — now formally a quasi-foundation\
  \ — as the primary builder of Gnosis infrastructure and ecosystem products.\n\n\
  Gnosis Ltd played a foundational role in the Gnosis ecosystem: it conducted the\
  \ original GNO token sale in 2017, and in 2021, divested 150k ETH, 8 million GNO,\
  \ and several third-party token positions into the newly formed GnosisDAO. Since\
  \ then, it has operated without requesting funding, relying on its retained assets.\n\
  \nAs of early 2025, Gnosis Ltd has successfully completed its legal transformation\
  \ into a quasi foundation (a Company Ltd by guarantee without share capital), eliminating\
  \ the dual equity-token structure and converting the entity into a purely purpose\
  \ driven organization, with the objective to further the Gnosis ecosystem and decentralised\
  \ technologies more generally. With the transition complete and reserves running\
  \ low, this proposal marks its first funding request to the DAO.\n\nWhile many entities\
  \ contribute, Gnosis Ltd is still the primary development and operations entity\
  \ in the Gnosis ecosystem. It builds and maintains the core infrastructure that\
  \ powers Gnosis Chain, and develops and supports major products, onboarding, BD,\
  \ and governance tooling for the community.\n\nThis proposal ensures continuity\
  \ and momentum for critical initiatives, while maintaining full alignment with the\
  \ DAO’s long-term interests.\n\n**Scope of Work & Budget Breakdown**\nThe requested\
  \ grant will cover Gnosis Ltd’s forecasted expenditure for a 12-month period, starting\
  \ July 1, 2025. Disbursements will occur quarterly, with each installment totaling\
  \ $7.5M in stablecoins. Funds will be sent to Gnosis Ltd’s Gnosis Safe.\n\nBelow\
  \ is a high-level breakdown of Gnosis Ltd’s budget for the next 12 months. There\
  \ are currently 127 team members and we’re expecting to onboard 25 more in the coming\
  \ year.\n\n**Product Development\t$15.5m**\nGnosis Pay\t$8.0m\nCircles\t$1.5m\n\

  \ software, offices\t\n\n**Management\t$0.45m**\nM/S/F\t$0.15m each\n\n**Reporting\
  \ and Accountability**\nGnosis Ltd will publish quarterly reports detailing spend\
  \ and progress across all budget categories.\n\nNo additional oversight structures\
  \ are proposed; DAO token holders retain ultimate accountability through governance.\n\
  \nFuture funding will depend on DAO review of outcomes and updated proposals.\n\n\
  Gnosis Ltd seeded the DAO. This proposal ensures the DAO can continue to rely on\
  \ it. Onwards and upwards! :rocket:"
