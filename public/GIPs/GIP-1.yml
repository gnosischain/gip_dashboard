title: One-time 5% GNO merkledrop to active GnosisDAO participants
body: 'See the [forum post](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-1-one-time-5-gno-airdrop-to-active-gnosisdao-participants/690)
  for discussion and more details.


  ## Simple Summary


  In order to incentivize existing GNO holders to immediately become active in the
  GnosisDAO, the GnosisDAO should merkledrop a 5% bonus to all Gnosis Safe addresses
  that participate in GIP snapshot voting within the first month after the GnosisDAO
  launches.


  ## Abstract


  The GnosisDAO will use a merkledrop to distribute, pro-rata, 5% of the balance GNO
  balance held in Gnosis Safes and used to vote in the GnosisDAO within the first
  month after the GnosisDAO launches. For example, a safe that holds 100 GNO and casts
  a vote for this (or any other) GIP proposal, within the time limit, would receive
  5 GNO tokens in the merkledrop.


  ## Motivation


  The motivation for this proposal is to immediately activate existing and new GNO
  token holders to become active in GnosisDAO governance decisions. This proposal
  would also help to further distribute GNO tokens in the community.


  ## Specification


  The merkledrop will use an instance of Balancer Labs'' [erc20-redeemable contracts](https://github.com/balancer-labs/erc20-redeemable/tree/master/merkle)
  and an instance of Balancer Labs'' [claim interface](https://claim.balancer.finance/#/).


  More detail will be added to the specification as becomes available.


  ## Rationale


  A merkledrop should be used, as opposed to other designs, so as to reduce the upfront
  gas cost and to require recipients to actively claim their bonus tokens.
