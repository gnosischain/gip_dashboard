title: Changes to gnosis.eth
body: "# Summary\nOn Jun 9, 2025, we stopped resolving Genome names on gnosis.eth,\
  \ while keeping the gno.eth domain intact. In short, [name].gno.eth will still resolve\
  \ to [name].gno, but [name].gnosis.eth will not.\n\n# Rationale\nSince [GIP-90](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-90-should-gnosis-eth-update-its-ens-resolver-to-resolve-gno-domains-on-gnosis-chain/7465),\
  \ the gnosis.eth domain was configured to resolve Genome 2 domains. Concretely speaking,\
  \ anyone could buy a domain name on Genome, say [name].gno, and the configured fields\
  \ (address, website, avatar, etc) would also resolve on [name].gnosis.eth. This\
  \ is quite problematic, as gnosis.eth should only be used for official purposes,\
  \ and these Genome domains could be used for phishing attacks and other nefarious\
  \ purposes.\n\nFor example, dao.gno (and thus dao.gnosis.eth) could be controlled\
  \ by ill-intentioned parties. Some other examples include delegates.gnosis.eth (actually\
  \ registered on the ENS resolver), forum.gnosis.eth, pay.gnosis.eth and any other\
  \ official looking names. The phishing aspect is why this was pushed through without\
  \ a GIP, as we did not want to give ideas to bad actors.\n\nIn addition to gnosis.eth,\
  \ the gno.eth domain was also set up to resolve Genome names. It’s the natural name\
  \ to use in any case, as one simply has to add .eth at the end of their .gno name\
  \ to make it work universally. If you own [name].gno on Genome, it’s natural and\
  \ makes more sense to use [name].gno.eth rather than [name].gnosis.eth. This functionality\
  \ was already available and stays unchanged.\n\n# Execution\nGiven the potential\
  \ for abuse, especially targeting official-looking domains, the core team decided\
  \ to act swiftly and temporarily suspend such resolutions. On Jun 9, 2025, we asked\
  \ Gateway to run a modified version of the Genome CCIP Resolver that the gnosis.eth\
  \ ENS uses to resolve names. The latter was initially configured after GIP-90 1\
  \ was approved. The new version simply doesn’t resolve anything for gnosis.eth,\
  \ except for vpn.gnosis.eth, which is currently being used to host the Gnosis VPN\
  \ website.\n\n# Next steps\nCurrently, Gateway effectively controls gnosis.eth.\
  \ For example, our Snapshot space can be configured by changing one text field on\
  \ gnosis.eth. While we trust Gateway, this is too much of a risk for the DAO in\
  \ our opinion, and opens it up for a variety of attacks.\n\nTo fully address this\
  \ issue, we plan to transition gnosis.eth back to the standard ENS Resolver. This\
  \ will effectively restore all the power exclusively to the DAO, ensuring that no\
  \ external process can alter the domain.\n\n# This proposal\nConcretely speaking,\
  \ this is the list of transactions that we are planning to execute in this proposal\
  \ in order to move gnosis.eth back to the ENS resolver. We are taking this opportunity\
  \ to also upgrade to [the latest version of the Public Resolver](https://docs.ens.domains/learn/deployments/#mainnet),\
  \ hence why all previously existing records are being recreated. The Twitter handle\
  \ was also updated to @GnosisDAO, as @gnosisPM has been deprecated.\n\nThe snapshot\
  \ field has been set to ipfs://QmQcMqCNepYVvUZiHzSL5FL43f646cgCY46sgoHmHdM551. This\
  \ is different from the previous version (ipfs://QmWUemB5QDr6Zkp2tqQRcEW1ZC7n4MiLaE6CFneVJUeYyD),\
  \ because the Snapshot space had actually been updated in https://app.safe.global/transactions/tx?safe=eth:0x0da0c3e52c977ed3cbc641ff02dd271c3ed55afe&id=multisig_0x0DA0C3e52C977Ed3cBc641fF02DD271c3ED55aFe_0x526d28f2c749e2319851dfa2440a04e01ad80ecaa2ec5bf8ac84cf6529e3da9a\
  \ to use the following configuration: https://bafkreicusfemxee7rwp42f3owjnclh2nsz5avcesrcme5oaol3qcxviwna.ipfs.4everland.io/\n\

  \ and security of critical infrastructure may, in rare instances, require prompt\
  \ and discretionary action by the core team or core developers—particularly in cases\
  \ where there is a potential risk to the DAO or the broader ecosystem. While decisions\
  \ affecting governance should ideally be made through open proposals and community\
  \ deliberation, extraordinary circumstances—such as critical security threats—may\
  \ necessitate temporary unilateral intervention under a defined mandate.\n\nTo support\
  \ responsible action in such situations, we intend to introduce a separate GIP outlining\
  \ a clear policy framework that would authorize limited unilateral measures by the\
  \ core team. This framework will include strict conditions on when emergency action\
  \ can be taken, obligations to notify the community through a post-action report\
  \ and provide for retrospective DAO review and oversight.\n\nWe remain committed\
  \ to transparency, accountability, and decentralization. Any such actions will be\
  \ taken with careful judgment, clear communication, and a commitment to respect\
  \ the DAO’s governance mechanisms . We welcome community feedback to help strike\
  \ the right balance between rapid response capability and decentralized governance."
