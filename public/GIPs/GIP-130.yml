title: Changes to gnosis.eth
body: "## Summary\n\nOn Jun 9, 2025, we stopped resolving Genome names on `gnosis.eth`,\
  \ while keeping the `gno.eth` domain intact. In short, `[name].gno.eth` will still\
  \ resolve to `[name].gno`, but `[name].gnosis.eth` will not.\n\n## Rationale\n\n\
  Since GIP-90, the `gnosis.eth` domain was configured to resolve Genome domains.\
  \ Concretely speaking, anyone could buy a domain name on Genome, say `[name].gno`,\
  \ and the configured fields (address, website, avatar, etc) would also resolve on\
  \ `[name].gnosis.eth`. This is quite problematic, as `gnosis.eth` should only be\
  \ used for official purposes, and these Genome domains could be used for phishing\
  \ attacks and other nefarious purposes.\n\nFor example, `dao.gno` (and thus `dao.gnosis.eth`)\
  \ could be controlled by ill-intentioned parties. Some other examples include `delegates.gnosis.eth`\
  \ (actually registered on the ENS resolver), `forum.gnosis.eth`, `pay.gnosis.eth`\
  \ and any other official looking names. The phishing aspect is why this was pushed\
  \ through without a GIP, as we did not want to give ideas to bad actors.\n\nIn addition\
  \ to `gnosis.eth`, the `gno.eth` domain was also set up to resolve Genome names.\
  \ It’s the natural name to use in any case, as one simply has to add `.eth` at the\
  \ end of their `.gno` name to make it work universally. If you own `[name].gno`\
  \ on Genome, it’s natural and makes more sense to use `[name].gno.eth` rather than\
  \ `[name].gnosis.eth`. This functionality was already available and stays unchanged.\n\
  \n## Execution\n\nGiven the potential for abuse, especially targeting official-looking\
  \ domains, the core team decided to act swiftly and temporarily suspend such resolutions.\
  \ On Jun 9, 2025, we asked Gateway to run a modified version of the Genome CCIP\
  \ Resolver that the `gnosis.eth` ENS uses to resolve names. The latter was initially\
  \ configured after GIP-90 was approved. The new version simply doesn’t resolve anything\
  \ for `gnosis.eth`, except for `vpn.gnosis.eth`, which is currently being used to\
  \ host the Gnosis VPN website.\n\n## Next steps\n\nCurrently, Gateway effectively\
  \ controls `gnosis.eth`. For example, our Snapshot space can be configured by changing\
  \ one text field on `gnosis.eth`. While we trust Gateway, this is too much of a\
  \ risk for the DAO in our opinion, and opens it up for a variety of attacks.\n\n\
  To fully address this issue, we plan to transition `gnosis.eth` back to the standard\
  \ ENS Resolver. This will effectively restore all the power exclusively to the DAO,\
  \ ensuring that no external process can alter the domain.\n\n## This proposal\n\n\
  Concretely speaking, this is the list of transactions that we are planning to execute\
  \ in this proposal in order to move `gnosis.eth` back to the ENS resolver. We are\
  \ taking this opportunity to also upgrade to the latest version of the Public Resolver,\
  \ hence why all previously existing records are being recreated. The Twitter handle\
  \ was also updated to `@GnosisDAO`, as `@gnosisPM` has been deprecated.\n\nThe `snapshot`\
  \ field has been set to `ipfs://QmQcMqCNepYVvUZiHzSL5FL43f646cgCY46sgoHmHdM551`.\
  \ This is different from the previous version (`ipfs://QmWUemB5QDr6Zkp2tqQRcEW1ZC7n4MiLaE6CFneVJUeYyD`),\
  \ because the Snapshot space had actually been updated in  to use the following\
  \ configuration: <\n\nProposed transactions:\n    \n    \n    [\n        {\n   \

  \ the integrity and security of critical infrastructure may, in rare instances,\
  \ require prompt and discretionary action by the core team or core developers—particularly\
  \ in cases where there is a potential risk to the DAO or the broader ecosystem.\
  \ While decisions affecting governance should ideally be made through open proposals\
  \ and community deliberation, extraordinary circumstances—such as critical security\
  \ threats—may necessitate temporary unilateral intervention under a defined mandate.\n\
  \nTo support responsible action in such situations, we intend to introduce a separate\
  \ GIP outlining a clear policy framework that would authorize limited unilateral\
  \ measures by the core team. This framework will include strict conditions on when\
  \ emergency action can be taken, obligations to notify the community through a post-action\
  \ report and provide for retrospective DAO review and oversight.\n\nWe remain committed\
  \ to transparency, accountability, and decentralization. Any such actions will be\
  \ taken with careful judgment, clear communication, and a commitment to respect\
  \ the DAO’s governance mechanisms . We welcome community feedback to help strike\
  \ the right balance between rapid response capability and decentralized governance.\n\
