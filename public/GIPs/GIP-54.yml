title: Should GnosisDAO support hosting and feature updates for Blockscout Explorer?
body: 'Blockscout


  Blockscout is an invaluable open-source tool for exploring, confirming, and inspecting
  transactions on the Gnosis Chain. It supports multiple token standards, provides
  a full-featured API, and offers real-time transaction tracking.


  Blockscout has been the primary explorer for Gnosis Chain since network inception.
  With the completed Gnosis/xDai merger, the responsibility to pay for hosting, maintenance,
  and updates for Blockscout should shift to the GnosisDAO.


  Project Details


  Goal


  The goal of this proposal is to provide continued hosting and maintenance for both
  the Gnosis Chain and Optimism on Gnosis Chain Blockscout instances.

  (1900GiB and growing) for the networks. Feature enhancements and priority support
  are also included as a part of the package.
