title: Should GnosisDAO support hosting and feature updates for Blockscout Explorer?
body: 'Blockscout


  Blockscout is an invaluable open-source tool for exploring, confirming, and inspecting
  transactions on the Gnosis Chain. It supports multiple token standards, provides
  a full-featured API, and offers real-time transaction tracking.


  Blockscout has been the primary explorer for Gnosis Chain since network inception.
  With the completed Gnosis/xDai merger, the responsibility to pay for hosting, maintenance,
  and updates for Blockscout should shift to the GnosisDAO.


  Project Details
