title: Should Gnosis DAO conduct a $30 million buyback program?
body: 'We suggest allocating approximately 5% of the Gnosis DAO assets, primarily
  SAFE, ETH, and stablecoins, to fund a $30 million buyback program. This proposal
  is aimed at bringing the price of GNO above the book value.



  **Goals**

  * Transfer value to long-term holders by acquiring GNO below its intrinsic value.
  The acquired tokens can be utilized for the growth and other initiatives of the
  DAO.

  * Signal to the market a commitment to establishing a valuation floor for GNO that
  consistently exceeds its book value.

  * Attract attention to the DAO''s products and community by enhancing the investment
  appeal of the GNO token.



  **Execution**

  To maximize the efficiency and minimize the risk of frontrunning, we suggest dividing
  the $30 million into two equal parts, each allocated to a certain strategy:

  1) $15 million for CoW-TWAP order, executed at any price below the dynamically-calculated
  book value over a six-month period.

  2) $15 million at the full discretion of Karpatkey, enabling them to capitalize
  on the most advantageous opportunities.



  While the framework and main details of the program are outlined in the proposal
  and elaborated on in the forum discussion, we believe the exact details of the asset
  composition, trading venues, and methods of financing buybacks (e.g., converting
  altcoins to ETH to be used in the program through market makers, OTC, or onchain),
  should be managed by Karpatkey. This delegation aims to minimize value leakage and
  ensure optimal execution.'
