  \ July 10, 2022, 8:11pm  1\n\n#  GIP-59 : Should GnosisDAO fund Circles UBI R&D\
  \ work?\n\n  * Let’s do this!! Go Circles!\n  * Make no changes\n\n\n\n0 voters\n\
  \n###  Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal would fund the [Circles Coop eG](http://circles.coop)\
  \ and the[ Bitsposessed](https://join.bitspossessed.org/) developer collective to\
  \ support the CirclesUBI team’s R&D costs for one and a half years and expand operations.\
  \ The following Circles UBI proposal would foster the mass adoption of key Gnosis\
  \ technologies like the Gnosis Safe via the establishment of UBI Open Pilots as\
  \ well as fostering internal collaboration between GnosisChain dapps through the\
  \ development of a Circles Web of Trust (WoT) GnosisSafe native app and other tools\
  \ at a total of USD - $3.571 Million, paid 45% in GNO and 55% in DAI, administered\
  \ by the Circles Coop eG.\n\n###  Abstract\n\nWith over 120,000 accounts deployed\
  \ so far via the circles.garden interface, [CirclesUBI](http://joincircles.net)\
  \ has established itself as a power dapp within GnosisChain, developing, maintaining\
  \ and promoting basic income public good infrastructures built within programmable\
  \ accounts via Gnosis Safe technology. The present proposal seeks funding for the\
  \ team’s operations plus a UBI Open pilot funding program for 1.5 years, and includes\
  \ a detailed budget on how the team plans to allocate the requested funds of USD\
  \ - $ 3.571 Million equivalent. Through funding the present proposal, GnosisDAO\
  \ would establish clear alignment with its core values of funding public goods and\
  \ support the development and improvement of infrastructure critical to ensuring\
  \ the sustainable scalability of the GnosisDAO and GnosisChain ecosystem.\n\nSee\
  \ Phase 1 [here](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-fund-circles-ubi-r-d-work-a-web-of-trust-dapp-for-gnosis-safe-ubi-as-public-goods/4936).\n\
  \n###  Motivation\n\nCirclesUBI is a basic income system for communities built on\
  \ the GnosisChain. CirclesUBI was coined first by Martin Koeppelmann during the\
  \ early days of Ethereum, merging ancient traditions of mutual credit with the idea\
  \ of Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) into [a system of personal currencies](https://handbook.joincircles.net/docs/developers/whitepaper/).\
  \ Since CirclesUBI launched in Berlin in October 2020 it has gained significant\
  \ attention from individuals and communities world-wide, with over 120,000 successfully\
  \ deployed GnosisSafes to date. Beyond the ongoing [Berlin Open Pilot](https://joincircles.net/business/)\
  \ and the communities who use Circles around the world, there are new instances\
  \ of the application being developed around the world, including a campaign by Expedition\
  \ Grundeinkommen in Berlin that started from May 2022 (circles.pink). This proposal\
  \ will support the development of a world-wide Circles Movement DAO to serve these\
  \ as well as other emerging communities.\n\nTo ensure our mission to make Circles\
  \ a planetary movement towards bringing UBI into the world, the Circles Coop and\
  \ the Bitspossessed collective have successfully relaunched Circles in order to\
  \ have an issuance rate based on time so that communities world-wide can more easily\
  \ anchor Circles to their own Units of Account and start exchanging using CRC. You\
  \ can read more about the recent transition and its benefits [here](https://circlesubi.medium.com/the-revaluation-of-the-circles-system-c6eea70e767d?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------).\n\
  \nWith the goal to further increase uptake, Circles Coop and Bitspossessed are now\
  \ focused on creating a resilient payments infrastructure without single points\
  \ of failure (SPOFs). Based on the online [Circles Market](http://market.joincircles.net),\
  \ the team is currently designing the specification to develop an OpenAPI so that\
  \ people across the planet can use their existing preferred payment methods to co-pay\
  \ with their CRC currency.\n\nAfter the successful [merge of XDAI/Gnosis](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904),\
  \ we believe it’s time to deliver on the promises of “developing the Gnosis Chain\
  \ ecosystem and incentivize usage”. In order to have a more resilient and interdependent\
  \ ecosystem, the CirclesUBI team wants to bring mutual benefit to the different\
  \ dapps within GnosisChain via the development of a [Circles Web of Trust ](https://protocol.bgnm.de/essays/sarah-friend/)(WoT)\
  \ dapp within GnosisSafe. A native WoT GnosisSafe app would provide pathways for\
  \ interoperability and integration between dapps, DAOs, GnosisChain POS validators,\
  \ other WoT networks like [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/),\
  \ [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) and more, embedding trusted relationships\
  \ and token systems within a modular and integrative WoT for GnosisChain.\n\nCircles\
  \ UBI Coop approaches its mid-term development through establishing revenue-generating\
  \ income sources to cover cost of production and re-invest the overflow into R&D.\
  \ The CirclesUBI team will develop a Community Currency Exchange, a social DEX that\
  \ promotes community finance (Co-Fi) via CRC group currencies and other alt-coins\
  \ like our sister project [Trustlines](https://trustlines.network/) (recently [decided](https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0x13f2908cc42a1d21872ff284b1f71bedd452781c3daf124221e67b13511e6bd1)\
  \ to move to GnosisChain), where SMEs and COOPs and municipalities can issue their\
  \ own community currencies and sell it for digital assets and DAI stablecoin in\
  \ return for future promises to their own production, creating healthier relationships\
  \ between investors within the Gnosis ecosystem and community/business members in\
  \ the Circles network, new DAO structures and more. The Gnosis ecosystem can further\
  \ benefit from the uptake of GnosisSafe infrastructure via CirclesUBI to non-crypto\
  \ natives, with over 120,000 safes deployed as of mid-2022 on Gnosis Chain (source:\
  \ [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/tschubotz/Gnosis-Chain-Gnosis-Safe-Circles)).\n\
  \nIn short, the Circles Coop & the Bitspossessed have assembled an extremely well\
  \ positioned team to stress-test, develop, maintain and expand underlying Gnosis\
  \ core infrastructure and drive Gnosis technologies to mass adoption via the implementation\
  \ of UBI on a planetary scale, which we believe to be a paradigm shift in how society\
  \ is organised. Gnosis currently provides the backbone infrastructure for this transition\
  \ to take place and our mission is to improve it through everyday usage with a wide\
  \ range of people.\n\n###  Specification\n\nThe Circles Coop and the Bitspossessed\
  \ collective seek to increase the size of the teams to a total of 24 full-time positions,\
  \ which will be employed over the course of 12 - 18 months, in order to develop,\
  \ maintain and expand the described tools. Furthermore, the proposal includes funding\
  \ for a Circles international ambassador position leading the community work within\
  \ the Circles Movement DAO and transferring the Circles Coop’s Berlin pilot learnings,\
  \ best-practices and research tools to better implement other Circles hubs around\
  \ the world.\n\nThe total budget requested for the CirclesUBI team (USD - $ 1.948\
  \ Million in DAI, 55 %) and to equip the Circles Movement DAO via the development\
  \ of Open UBI Pilots (USD - $ 1.5 Million in GNO, 45 %) is USD - $ 3.571 Million.\
  \ The full budget details of the present CirclesUBI proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ORy9d2pw7IJoub05s5MuVLBD3kRyUqpQmJnMG1KhdR4/edit#gid=156254642).\n\
  \n###  Rationale\n\nThe [CirclesUBI technical roadmap](https://nubo.bitspossessed.org/s/jYMDYoA6ecZNFXw)\
  \ is public and was created by the [Bitspossessed](https://join.bitspossessed.org/),\
  \ the team that maintains and develops the CirclesUBI core codebase. Its chief priorities\
  \ for 2022 include improvements to the pathfinder algorithm, including hardening\
  \ transfer through transactions to improve the overall functionality and usability\
  \ of the Circles network, as well as developing a Circles Payment API & co-payment\
  \ functionality. For Q4 2022 and 2023, priorities lay on developing a general purpose\
  \ GnosisSafe Web of Trust (WoT) native app and tooling based on the Circles WoT\
  \ to encourage more on-chain collaboration and a Community Currency DEX. All of\
  \ this is to ensure that the already existing living communities using Circles can\
  \ have a better user-experience. In terms of promises to the GnosisDAO, we divide\
  \ these into two:\n\n####  1\\. Development of Gnosis Infrastructure & Public Goods:\n\
  \n  * Development of a GnosisSafe Web of Trust (WoT) native dapp & modular tooling\
  \ for the GnosisChain ecosystem: The Circles WoT provides a network of trusted peers\
  \ which can be used by different projects building on GnosisChain so that other\
  \ dapps can build on top of it using their own token network or connecting it with\
  \ other WoT networks (e.g. BrightID, Proof of Humanity, etc) and established more\
  \ aligned strategic pathways for collaboration. R&D will take place in the following\
  \ areas:\n\n    * Robust network reputation system for staking on GnosisChain via\
  \ the future Gnosis WoT & R&D on scaling GnosisChain through the Circles WoT and\
  \ projects like Dappnode.\n    * Trust relations between and within DAOs using GnosisSafes.\n\
  \    * Modular collaboration and integration between dapps in the GnosisChain ecosystem.\
  \ Think Proof of Humanity, Trustlines, BrightID, Circles and many more!\n    * Embed\
  \ real time economic trade data onto the blockchain to support the development of\
  \ more transparent, sustainable and trusted supply chains via the UBI pilots research.\n\
  \    * Pathfinder algorithm R&D - useful for other projects with native tokens to\
  \ do their own transactions using an integrated WoT dapp.\n    * Modular extensibility\
  \ of the transfer through methods.\n    * More non-market driven transactions, such\
  \ as recent Proof of Active Participation (POAP) efforts. * R&D into a future $WOT\
  \ token for the Web of Trust dapp for GNO token holders, similar to the $SAFE token\
  \ proposal.\n  * CirclesUBI Open Pilots: Leveraging Gnosis technology, the CirclesUBI\
  \ Open Pilots provide a strategic framework to go from basic income pilots to basic\
  \ income policy and basic income systems around the planet. The Circles Coop is\
  \ currently expanding the Berlin Open Pilot and plan to spread CirclesUBI more formally\
  \ into other regions as part of a Circles Movement, planning to expand the support\
  \ for open pilots by the end of 2023, where the [joincircles.net](http://joincircles.net)\
  \ will become a neutral platform for all projects using Circles and other wallet\
  \ instances, such as circles.pink (Expedition Grundeinkommen). The Circles Movement\
  \ DAO will work as a governance mechanism to allocate funds accordingly for the\
  \ implementation of these pilots to the communities that want to implement Circles\
  \ locally in a transparent way. Our go-to-market strategy is working with the B2B\
  \ sectors to increase productive capacity, develop infrastructure and go to key\
  \ stakeholders, such as established communities already using CRC, local municipalities\
  \ and regional governments interested in implementing basic income, in order to\
  \ create more ecological and transparent value chains. UBI is one of the main pillars\
  \ for the 21st century economy and a social ecologically just transition, especially\
  \ given the current context of supply chain disruptions and rising inflation. We\
  \ strongly believe GnosisChain and Gnosis technologies more generally provide a\
  \ strategic backbone for this transition to take place.\n\n  * Circles Payment API:\
  \ In order to have a scalable system and reach millions of people, we are focusing\
  \ on creating an open source payment API so that Circles can be used in a plug and\
  \ play basis, allowing people to co-pay with their UBI using existing payment infrastructures\
  \ and habits, such as debit cards, marketplaces and other payment applications.\n\
  \n\n\n\n####  2, Fulfilling the Promise of Investment Opportunities to GNO holders\n\
  \n  * Community Currency DEX: Based on Circles group currencies (currently being\
  \ developed by third party teams), a social DEX will create incentives for GNO holders\
  \ via investment opportunities in strategic future tokens emerging from the development\
  \ and deployment of the platform, as well as ROI from overflow investments in SMEs\
  \ and COOPs who sell their tokens to the communities that support them, liquidity-pool\
  \ provider incentives and more. To achieve this, we are exploring collaboration\
  \ with MakerDAO for integrations and researching deployment of e.g. the Juicebox\
  \ protocol on the GnosisChain. We are open for suggestions and potential synergies\
  \ to collaborate with existing DEX infrastructures (e.g. Honeyswap, 1hive, Uniswap,\
  \ Cowswap) within GnosisChain to design a specific-purpose social DEX that is directed\
  \ at the real economy.\n  * Indirect benefits for GNO holders: Due to further increasing\
  \ uptake of GnosisSafes and transactions being incentivized by Circles communities,\
  \ the revenue model of GnosisChain (e.g. transaction fees, staking rewards, etc.)\
  \ will in turn benefit all GNO token holders and those participating in the maintenance\
  \ and improvement of Gnosis Chain. We also expect benefits coming from Web of Trust\
  \ R&D.\n\n\n\nAll funds not spent will be at Circles Coop e.G. discretion.\n\nUnconditionally,\n\

  It seems to me that circles is really doing a few different things: 1) attempting\
  \ to create technology around web identity using your web of trust app 2) experimenting\
  \ in a ubi. It’s difficult for me to see the usefulness of both. The WoT is obviously\
  \ something that could fundamentally help problem areas within crypto and on gnosis.\
  \ The UBI experiment on the other hand seems less useful and successful. The technology\
  \ behind it seems great for the Web of Trust part but a group of people just decided\
  \ to change the amount of ubi from 200 plus euros a month to 79 euros a month. How\
  \ is this fundamentally different from our current centralized system of governance?\
  \ A group of powerful people determined to make the amount of income less (seems\
  \ like a standard fiat government) I understand the reasoning behind it but my guess\
  \ is while these systems are subsidized with fiat they will function well but when\
  \ you take that funding away this promise of world wide adoption seems grossly exaggerated.\
  \ How has the experiment shown any real success without being subsidized by fiat\
  \ (therefore being a part of the very system it strongly critiques) I see more than\
  \ half of this budget going to an unproven system that really isn’t producing a\
  \ ubi in the first place. It still has a unit of measurement that people accumulate\
  \ and over spend called trust, and if you don’t have it you don’t have a ubi and\
  \ if you do you can purchase more, and while I think it’s an interesting philosophy,\
  \ it seems a waste of resources. The WoT app technology could be budgeted a lot\
  \ more than it is and the other reduced (but then the idea of ubi unbacked by fiat\
  \ would have to stand on its own which it doesn’t seem likely to me that it will\
  \ do).\n\n4 Likes\n\n[Crusader](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Crusader) July 12, 2022,\

  \ July 12, 2022, 7:57am  11\n\nDear maessedai,\n\nthank you for your inputs and\
  \ concerns. Let me explain a few things:\n\n  * Circles didn’t transition from 240\
  \ € to 72 € a month, but from 240 CRC to 720 CRC, the fiat price signal is just\
  \ a local incentive in Berlin, nowhere else ([here](https://circlesubi.medium.com/the-revaluation-of-the-circles-system-c6eea70e767d)\
  \ is the full article about the transition: “As before, outside of the laboratory\
  \ (Berlin Pilot), the pricing of products and services offered in Circles is up\
  \ to the community to agree upon, which determines how much value people can claim\
  \ with their CRC.”)\n\n  * this price signal in the Berlin Pilot is just one out\
  \ of many (possibly millions), if you consider every market participant can set\
  \ their own rate, so central groups of power can possibly only have a timely advantage,\
  \ but no lasting leverage\n\n  * the reasonable budget for incentivising the Circles\
  \ economy is not simply planned for cashing out, rather incentivising ambassadors\
  \ to onboard communities without the huge extent of a subsidy or cash-out program\
  \ while launching minimal-viable-circles (MVCs), which are closed and enable businesses\
  \ to spend CRC instead cashing them out\n\n  * we are working closely with the [FRIBIS](https://www.fribis.uni-freiburg.de/en/project/netfi-en/)\
  \ (University Freiburg) comparing how these MVCs work in comparison with other basic\
  \ income systems around the world, so a final conclusion of its success cannot be\
  \ drawn yet\n\n  * our strategy is that Circles can be used by local governments\
  \ as an infrastructure/protocol to deploy UBI and we are actively exploring collaboration\
  \ with public bodies, so in our view it is not public vs. private UBI, but rather\
  \ a partnership\n\n\n\n\nHope that helps a bit to digest our work.\n\nCheers, Andreas\
  \ (in behalf of the Circles Coop)\n\n5 Likes\n\n[maessedai](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/maessedai)\
  \ July 12, 2022, 1:43pm  12\n\nI was aware that I was referring to the change in\
  \ fiat backing in Berlin which was a change in the amount of fiat and an increase\
  \ in the amount of circles coin. So the question becomes with this change will prices\
  \ of items go up in circles? Of course they will because they are worth less now\
  \ in fiat. If the system actually worked the purchasing power of the increase in\
  \ circles would compensate the change in backing of fiat but it won’t because of\
  \ economics. Imagine maker changing the basis of the peg to decrease the amount\
  \ of collateral. This really isn’t different. Where is the proof that this idea\
  \ is anything but fantasy when unbacked by fiat? Look I do not begrudge you the\
  \ experiment (although I would say historically this philosophy has been proven\
  \ to fail time and time again with larger population sizes) but the ask is for much\
  \ more budget towards the less proven answer to a need. This is my issue. And my\
  \ issue is that it proposes to be a more fair system than our current system when\
  \ we have already seen an abuse of power to change the amount of fiat backing. Did\
  \ everyone in the Berlin community agree to that or was it directed by those in\
  \ charge of the experiment? I appreciate your work and particularly the usefulness\
  \ of the technology, but it seems an unproven philosophy is eating a lot of the\
  \ success of the tech rather than being utilized for the most common good.\n\n4\

  \ a driver to get users involved with Gnosis Chain. However - I am against this\
  \ specific proposal as it is done only by one of the many teams working on Circles\
  \ and I feel Gnosis should support a united effort instead of uncoordinated approaches.\n\
  \nLong-form:  \nI came up with the idea for CirclesUBI many many years ago ([around\
  \ 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421203148/https://www.pledgebank.com/neuesGeld))\
  \ and in [2015 formalized](https://web.archive.org/web/20181019213744/https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/2228/circles-universal-basic-income)\
  \ the ideas with pseudo code and described it as a system running on Ethereum. In\
  \ November 2015 I presented the idea to a wider Ethereum audience at Devcon1 in\
  \ London. Since then [many people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZf0xBF_X3M&ab_channel=AmphiMonge)\
  \ and groups have been working over the years on Circles. Including a “spoke” within\
  \ ConsenSys and a group of people connected to the MakerDAO ecosystem.\n\nToday\
  \ there are at the very least 4 groups working on and around Circles. Coop/Bits;\
  \ Circles Land, Circles Bali and Bootnode working on Group currencies under Gnosis\
  \ supervision. Now this proposal was unilaterally done by Coop/Bits and did not\
  \ coordinate with the other groups. To me, for Gnosis to support Circles and such\
  \ a significant way a few more requirements are necessary: a united approach and\
  \ already more clear traction for this shared approach.\n\nCirlces is a project\
  \ I am very passionate about and I do believe it can be a great usecase for Gnosis\
  \ Chain but it will only succeed in a united effort.\n\nAttached a “timeline” of\

  \ July 16, 2022, 6:15pm  18\n\nI’m confused by your use of the term ‘fiat backing’\
  \ here. This currency is not a commodity backed by fiat or other asset. It’s not\
  \ a bearer asset either, and the WoT performs a critical fundamental function that\
  \ helps alleviate the problems associated with the Trilemma any currency faces when\
  \ attempting to interface with other economies.\n\nUsing the existing units of account\
  \ in place is a natural Schelling point of coordination because everyone has assets,\
  \ ongoing expenses, and/or debts that are valued in it. This just serves as a control,\
  \ even when using some % of that standard instead of 1:1.\n\nYou’re right that if\
  \ you came in unilaterally & made a change to that for everyone in an existing economy,\
  \ it’d be disruptive to say the least. But that’s not what happened here (on either\
  \ end of the stick). There’s no ‘economy’ yet; no unpaid wages, debt, or inventory\
  \ was locked in at the old ratio. No one bought Circles. There are no unrealized\
  \ losses involved, just sellers adjusting their price tags, as they do on a regular\
  \ basis anyway. In this case, the control values of the listed goods in EUR doesn’t\
  \ change, only how many CRC are moving.\n\nImportantly, this change came about from\
  \ outside of the Circles Coop and Berlin, an important indicator of decentralization.\
  \ The Circles community in Munich instigated the idea in autonomous style (they\
  \ are established as Circles Land & even have their own UI). This was neither centrally\
  \ enforced nor a product of the market or other coordination beyond Munich. Even\
  \ though the 2 groups did not agree on the change, maintaining the coordination\
  \ outweighed ‘market sovereignty’, or whatever you want to call it.\n\nAlso, if\
  \ you want to add an ‘unproven philosophy’ to the table, please name & describe\

  \ language that we all are using, some from the old paradigm & some from the new.\
  \ It can be very confusing, especially as new combinations of familiar concepts\
  \ are presented.\n\nI think most will agree that a united effort is important for\
  \ a project’s success.  \nI also think most will agree that decentralization is\
  \ important for a project’s success too.\n\nIt appears necessary that we outline\
  \ an early systems map of the different groups involved, and the roles each plays,\
  \ connections between, etc.\n\nTo my eyes, the layers beyond the core Coop/Bits\
  \ group exist externally because they want to focus on other areas or ideas. IE,\
  \ they identify as separate (fork) intentionally, to free themselves of the constraints\
  \ of the base mission of the Coop, as well as the time it would take to always coordinate\
  \ their own ideas with other groups. From this POV, it seems strange to require\
  \ coordination between groups on topics that they essentially opted out of.\n\n\
  But maybe your focus was not aimed at the past so much as the future? If significant\
  \ investments are coming from Gnosis, it certainly makes sense to look at the big\
  \ picture, and try to identify if there are similar needs in the other groups before\
  \ committing to one.\n\nWhat kind of shared approach would you like to see?\n\n\
  One issue I think is less complicated: the funding for salaries (both new & existing)\
  \ enables human existence in this world, and those key member nodes of the network\
  \ should not still be living like seasonal/migrant workers. Knowing your job is\
  \ funded beyond a month or 2 is important to well being, as well as attracting quality\
  \ people.\n\nMaybe it would be better to separate these issues into separate proposals?\n\

  \  20\n\nI have a few things to say here, in relation to Martin’s critique of the\
  \ proposal above\n\n  * The proposal explicitly states that the funding is for the\
  \ Circles Coop eG and Bitsposessed. It never claims that these teams represent the\
  \ whole of the Circles Ecosystem, and it does not downplay work being done by other\
  \ teams. It is totally within the right of any team to make a proposal\n\n  * As\
  \ far as I understand, many Circles teams have been (at least partially) funded\
  \ by Martin up until this point. In seeking funding from GnosisDAO Coop/Bits is\
  \ now obviously seeking a degree of independence and funding stability. I am sympathetic\
  \ to how that might be challenging for Martin, especially given that he started\
  \ the project, but much of the recent day-to-day work on Circles has been spearheaded\
  \ by Coop/Bits, and they have a right to seek more formal funding\n\n  * I feel\
  \ the history laid out by Martin downplays the work of the Coop/Bits team somewhat.\
  \ In my experience they are a highly active team who have initiated many Circles\
  \ projects. For the record, I actually have followed the Circles project since it\
  \ was just a rough blog post written by Martin, and over the years I’ve seen the\
  \ various groups that have been drawn into it - for example, I even advised Jason\
  \ Hickel (mentioned by Martin in his diagram) in London when he was trying to figure\
  \ out what Circles was and whether it was promising\n\n  * Martin says he is resistant\
  \ because he wants the teams to be coordinated, but I don’t see any plan for how\
  \ that will be acheived. The Coop/Bits team is making a concrete proposal for moving\
  \ ahead, and in the absense of seeing a concrete alternative multi-team coordination\
  \ proposal I don’t see a strong reason for why they should be blocked on this\n\n\
