title: Karpatkey DAO Service Extension
body: 'Should GnosisDAO implement GIP-58, as detailed in the following forum post?:
  https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-58-karpatkey-dao-service-extension/5417



  After the GIP-20 6 approval, the development and sustainable growth of the Gnosis
  Chain became a top priority for GnosisDAO. Even though efficient treasury management
  is still a must for GnosisDAO’s evolution, the scope of our work has to encompass
  more in order to take the Gnosis Chain to the next level, co-creating a safe, trustworthy
  ecosystem.


  We increased our headcount and went beyond the scope of GIP-20 to be able to adequately
  cater to Gnosis’ current needs.


  This proposal focuses on the Gnosis Chain and treasury development, seeking to reduce
  risk exposure, develop anti-liquidation bots to increase capital efficiency, update
  our security protocol, run security audits, further improve our reporting, execute
  and manage a sustainable rewards plan for new and existing protocols in the GC,
  and scout attractive new ones to make them part of the GC.'
