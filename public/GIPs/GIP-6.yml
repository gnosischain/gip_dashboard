title: Deploy Gnosis Auction
body: "##  Update (19/02/2021)\n\nAccording to GnosisDAO’s governance process I promote\
  \ this proposal to the consensus phase (Phase 3).  \nVoting is available here  \n\
  A link to the audit report for Gnosis Auction smart contracts was added to the Implementation\
  \ section of this proposal.\n\n##  Simple Summary\n\nThis GIP intends to answer\
  \ the question: Should GnosisDAO deploy GnosisAuction?\n\n##  Abstract\n\nThis is\
  \ the phase-II continuation to Should GnosisDAO build an IDO specific Dapp?\n\n\
  GnosisAuction would build on the proven success with token sales that Gnosis Protocol\
  \ (GP) v1 (Mesa) had. It will provide a sturdy mechanism that supports fair price\
  \ finding in token sales. It will also aim to be modular enough to work in other\
  \ scenarios where auctions are needed.\n\n##  Motivation\n\nGnosis Protocol v1 was\
  \ successful with multiple token sales, including some high profile ones such as\
  \ mStable and API3. Nonetheless, the protocol was not developed with this specific\
  \ use-case in mind. Additionally, after hitting the market, many users suggested\
  \ multiple improvements.\n\nSome of the suggested improvements included:\n\n  *\
  \ Making the UX more simple\n  * Reducing the number of transactions required to\
  \ trade\n  * Improve gas efficiency\n  * Reduce attack vectors\n\n\n\nThough these\
  \ improvements are being addressed in the development of Gnosis Protocol v2 (GPv2),\
  \ it still plans to be a DEX that is not aimed at token sales and other kinds of\
  \ auctions. Thus, it is important to address this segment of the market that has\
  \ proven demand.\n\nGnosisAuction still takes some of the most important benefits\
  \ from GPv1, out of which the following two stand out:\n\n  * Single closing price\
  \ per auction, which is the fairest price-finding mechanism\n  * MEV resistance,\
  \ which prevents miners and frontrunners from extracting value\n\n\n\nFinally, it\
  \ is important to note that there is no general auction smart contract ready to\
  \ use in the market. Some of the use-cases that the contract could also be used\
  \ for include:\n\n  * Auctions to repay debt on shortfall events of lending protocols\
  \ like AAVE\n  * Liquidations\n  * Token buy backs\n  * Price discovery for all\
  \ sorts of assets\n\n\n\n##  Specification\n\nGnosisAuction may be used as a tool\
  \ by anyone hoping to auction off a predefined amount of tokens. Anyone can bid\
  \ to buy these tokens by placing a buy-order with a specified limit price during\
  \ the whole bidding time, subject to any potential customisations/restrictions placed\
  \ by the auctioneer. At the end of the predefined auction time, the final price\
  \ is calculated by the following method: The buy volumes from the highest bids are\
  \ getting added up until this sum reaches the initial sell volume. The limit price\
  \ of the bid that increases the overall buy volume to the initial sell volume is\
  \ setting the uniform clearing price. All bids with a higher price will be settled\
  \ and traded against the initial sell volume with the clearing price. All bids with\
  \ a lower price will not be considered for the settlement and users will be able\
  \ to withdraw their committed funds.\n\nGnosis auction will initially have a simple\
  \ UI so buyers can place their bids. A draft of the interface can be seen below,\
  \ which will aim to use the gnosis-auction.eth domain.\n\n![ 1596×1184 127 KB ](//forum.gnosis.io/uploads/default/original/1X/01ff03ffac18dc194e0aa4a8cfc46f387fa30daa.png)\n\
  \nAt first, auctioneers (sellers) will have to interact directly with the code in\
  \ order to run an auction. Nonetheless, simple, yet comprehensive documentation\
  \ will be written to make this easy for sellers to set up. Subject to legal considerations,\
  \ eventually an auctioneer interface may be built.\n\n##  Rationale\n\nAs stated\
  \ above, GnosisAuction is a software tool to cater primarily to those hoping to\
  \ conduct IDOs, which are currently an underserved market. GPv1 was not aimed at\
  \ fulfilling this market, and GPv2 is geared towards being a DEX-aggregator/general\
  \ purpose DEX.\n\nRegarding other models considered, batch auctions were preferred\
  \ over Dutch Auctions mainly because:\n\n  * Dutch Auctions have high activity near\
  \ the end, high gas prices or other infrastructure issues could be fatal on a critical\
  \ event as a token sale or shortfall event\n  * DutchAuctions calculate their price\
  \ based on blocktime, which makes it hard to predict\n  * Dutch Auctions cause a\
  \ gas war near the end of the auction, causing competition based on gas bidding\
  \ instead of the limit price set buy buyers of the auction\n  * On Dutch Auctions,\
  \ bidders need to wait until the auction price reaches the maximum amount that they\
  \ are willing to pay, or else they risk paying more than they wanted. With this\
  \ implementation, users can set their limit price (maximum amount they are willing\
  \ to pay) from the start, and never pay more than what they determine.\n\n\n\n##\
  \  Implementation\n\nThe specific information on the contract can be followed up\
  \ in this repository.  \nThe audit report can be found here\n\n4 Likes\n"
