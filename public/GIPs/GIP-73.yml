title: Should GnosisDAO give a grant to Pluser?
body: 'Website: https://www.pluser.io/


  # Introduction

  The collapse of FTX showed that we can’t trust a centralized exchange. But currently,
  there is no simple and safe non-custodial alternative for keeping crypto, investing,
  and using web3. We want to show you our solution to the problems of cryptocurrency
  wallets.


  # Summary

  We would like to ask for a grant for the amount of 50000 USD/DAI from Gnosis DAO
  to create Pluser wallet. Pluser is the safest and simplest cryptocurrency wallet
  for the retail market on Gnosis Chain. Our wallet is built on top of Gnosis Safe
  contracts, Chainlink oracles, and Torus network.
