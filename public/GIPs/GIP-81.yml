title: Should GnosisDAO fund CirclesUBI Indonesia’s product testing launch?
body: 'After discussion with GnosisDAO, CirclesUBI.id is submitting a revised proposal
  to fund Milestone 1 associated with the product testing and participant onboarding
  in Bali, Indonesia.


  CirclesUBU.id will receive €500,000 once the GIP passes in order to hit Milestone
  1 of 1500 participants in product testing across 17 villages.


  Here’s the definition of onboarded participants:


  1. Onboarding of Field Officers/Local Champions.

  a) +20 people successfully follow a training program, and pass screening to ensure
  they can support their communities + conduct effective troubleshooting & survey
  interviews during 3 months of the roll out period.

  b) These 20 people ensure 1500 participants are successfully onboarded.


  2. Onboarding of Testing Participants (users).

  a) 1500 participants have successfully attended the user onboarding workshop and
  understand how to use their Circles account, have created their circles user account
  + a shop account that is visible on the circles marketplace.


  3. Active participants (retention rate).

  a) # of users that conduct at least 1 translation per week and participate in feedback
  interviews about the product performance and benefits.

  4. Inactive participants.

  a) Are not actively using the app at least 1 x per week, and participate in feedback
  interviews aimed to determine what the reasons are that they are not using the app.'
