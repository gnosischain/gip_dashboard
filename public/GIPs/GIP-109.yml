title: 'Should the GnosisDAO introduce Snapshot moderators to reduce spam? '
body: "The Gnosis DevOps team is currently performing a review and overhaul of the\
  \ GnosisDAO’s Snapshot space. We would like to add trusted moderators that have\
  \ the ability to remove posts that they deem to be low-quality with the goal of\
  \ reducing spam proposals created in the GnosisDAO’s snapshot space.\n\nFor security\
  \ reasons, the GnosisDAO Snapshot space does not have Admins. In order to introduce\
  \ moderation, the GnosisDAO needs to grant the DevOps team permission to modify\
  \ the Snapshot settings.\n\nAdding trusted moderators was originally proposed in\
  \ GIP-77, which never went to Snapshot for onchain voting.\n\nThis GIP proposes\
  \ to elect the following moderators: Manuel Bondy, Armagan Ercan, and John Szczepaniak\
  \ who are trusted contributors of the GnosisDAO.\n\nhttps://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-77-should-the-gnosisdao-add-delegation-spam-reduction/6362\n\
  \nModeration guidelines are taken from A Code of Conduct for Open Source Communities,\
  \ a widely recognized code of conduct that empowers groups to facilitate healthy,\
  \ constructive community behavior. \n\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md"
