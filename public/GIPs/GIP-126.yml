title: Should the GnosisDAO Renew its Long-Term Partnership With Nethermind for Gnosis
  Chain Maintenance?
body: "## Summary\n\nNethermind has established a partnership with Gnosis through\
  \ GIP-47. This proposal renews the long-term strategic collaboration with Nethermind\
  \ for the continued maintenance and development of the Gnosis Chain. Nethermind\
  \ has consistently demonstrated responsibility for the chain’s security, stability,\
  \ and alignment with the Ethereum roadmap, extending far beyond the scope of a single\
  \ client implementation.\n\nIf approved, GnosisDAO will allocate 750,000 DAI in\
  \ the first year, starting in June 2025, with annual increases of 4% to fund Nethermind’s\
  \ ongoing contributions.\n\n## Motivation\n\nNethermind is a high-performance, .NET\
  \ based Ethereum Execution Client that has played a foundational role in the development\
  \ of the Gnosis Chain. Known for its reliable synchronization, efficient block processing,\
  \ and robust plugin architecture, the Nethermind client consistently delivers utility\
  \ and stability.  \nOver the past few years, Nethermind has evolved from being solely\
  \ a client provider to becoming a core contributor across many aspects of the Gnosis\
  \ Chain infrastructure. This includes serving as the supermajority client and supporting\
  \ DevOps, testing, and research. As the Gnosis Chain continues to be a critical\
  \ piece of infrastructure, Nethermind remains crucial for its ongoing development\
  \ and long-term success.\n\n## Past Contributions\n\nNethermind has played a crucial\
  \ role in ensuring the reliable and stable operation of the Gnosis Chain. Nethermind\
  \ has delivered on the promises from GIP-47, some of them were reprioritized and\
  \ changed with other ones. Moreover, the Nethermind team has contributed to more\
  \ areas than originally outlined in GIP-47. Nethermind has contributed to the following\
  \ areas:\n\n  * **Hardforks** : The Nethermind team, in collaboration with Gnosis,\
  \ has successfully navigated multiple hardforks. Nethermind has never been limited\
  \ to client development alone, but has also taken full ownership of all testing\
  \ related to hardforks. The team was responsible for testing and ensuring that all\
  \ upgrades ran smoothly. With The Merge, Gnosis Chain was migrated from AuRa consensus\
  \ to PoS, with Nethermind being the sole client that went through the transition.\
  \ During Shapella, Gnosis Chain introduced withdrawals. The Dencun and Pectra hardforks\
  \ on Gnosis Chain were delivered before their activation on the Ethereum mainnet.\
  \ All of these hardforks were delivered with such quality that the chain, users,\
  \ and node runners did not experience a single major issue.\n  * **Client Improvements:**\
  \ Over the past three years, Nethermind has made significant advancements. The Nethermind\
  \ client is fully ready to scale Gnosis Chain without sacrificing decentralization.\
  \ This progress is visible in its adoption on the Ethereum Mainnet. Nethermind was\
  \ initially used by only 1–3% of nodes on Ethereum, but now plays an important role\
  \ in Ethereum client diversity, running on at least 29.3% of Ethereum validators.\
  \ During these years, Nethermind team has made countless improvements across many\
  \ areas such as the general performance, stability of the client, JSON-RPC, health\
  \ checks, plugin architecture, state DB layout, and pruning. Gnosis Chain can also\
  \ benefit from super-fast snap-sync.\n  * **Chain Health & Client Stability:** As\
  \ the supermajority client on Gnosis Chain, Nethermind has played a key role in\
  \ maintaining the network’s safety and stability over the years. Gnosis Chain has\
  \ experienced no downtime, and all significant issues have been promptly addressed\
  \ in close collaboration with the Gnosis team. Furthermore, Nethermind has actively\
  \ supported efforts to onboard additional execution clients to the Gnosis Chain.\n\
  \  * **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Nethermind has initiated and managed all networks\
  \ used for testing, including devnets and shadow forks. Additionally, the Nethermind\
  \ team set up the Chiado network and previously maintained the majority of its validators.\
  \ Currently, Nethermind maintains 30% of the Chiado validators.\n  * **Encrypted\
  \ Mempools:** Nethermind delivered the first encrypted mempool implementation in\
  \ its client using the Shutter protocol, bringing censorship resistance and frontrunning\
  \ protection to Gnosis Chain. The team has contributed to the specification, implementation,\
  \ and ongoing research efforts that help shape its roadmap.\n  * **Testing & Tooling:**\
  \ The team has been working on adopting a variety of testing tools and repositories\
  \ for use on Gnosis Chain. This includes tools and repositories such as Hive, t8n,\
  \ EEST, consensus-specs. The goal of these efforts is to ensure that network-specific\
  \ features (for example base fee collector, and withdrawals) are tested with Ethereum\
  \ Mainnet-level quality. This also facilitates the onboarding of other clients.\
  \ Additionally, the team has implemented monitoring for Hive tests and maintains\
  \ a page displaying hive tests results.\n\n\n\n## Scope of Work & Team\n\nNethermind\
  \ proposes to continue supporting and improving the Gnosis Chain and the broader\
  \ ecosystem. The main goal of this proposal is to ensure the continued maintenance\
  \ of the Gnosis Chain. The scope of work includes:\n\n  * Maintaining the Nethermind\
  \ Client as a performant and reliable execution client on the Gnosis Chain.\n  *\
  \ Delivering changes from the Ethereum roadmap in a timely manner. This includes\
  \ adopting Ethereum mainnet upgrades to the Gnosis Chain when necessary. As an ongoing\
  \ agreement this includes all future hardforks. In the near term, the current focus\
  \ will be: \n    * Fusaka – the upcoming hard fork for both Ethereum and Gnosis\
  \ Chain\n    * Glamsterdam – the subsequent hard fork\n    * History expiry – which\
  \ aims to reduce disk requirements for node operators\n    * Statelessness – an\
  \ ongoing effort; the direction has recently shifted from Verkle tries to binary\
  \ tries, with binary tries currently being prototyped\n  * Continuously improve\
  \ the client’s ability to handle higher throughput, optimize disk usage, and enhance\
  \ synchronization performance.\n  * Maintain the encrypted mempool solution.\n \
  \ * Develop, adopt and maintain custom EIPs required by the Gnosis Chain.\n  * Optimize\
  \ the design of the Nethermind archive node to reduce storage requirements.\n  *\
  \ Assist with adopting Ethereum testing infrastructure for Gnosis (e.g., hive, t8n,\
  \ EEST) and extend it to support Gnosis Chain–specific features.\n  * Support hardfork\
  \ testing, including devnets, Kurtosis setups, and shadow forks.\n  * Continue maintaining\
  \ Chiado and other critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe broader Nethermind core team\
  \ comprises over 20 engineers contributing to both the Gnosis Chain and Ethereum\
  \ Mainnet. For Gnosis Chain, Nethermind allocates a dedicated subset of engineers\
  \ based on shifting priorities and workload demands. The number of team members,\
  \ including engineers, testers, DevOps specialists, and support staff, varies over\
  \ time and can scale up during major upgrades or critical initiatives. This dynamic\
  \ approach ensures efficient resource allocation while reinforcing Nethermind’s\
  \ strong commitment to the stability, seamless upgrades, and continuous development\
  \ of the Gnosis Chain.\n\n## Funding Request:\n\nThis proposal seeks to renew the\
  \ previous grant to enable Nethermind to continue its commitment to and maintenance\
  \ of the Gnosis Chain.\n\nAn ongoing grant of 750,000 DAI is requested for the first\
  \ year, starting in June 2025, with a 4% increase each subsequent year.\n\nPayments\
  \ to be made at the beginning of each quarter, first payment in June 2025.\n\nThis\
  \ funding will enable the Nethermind team to maintain its current structure and\
  \ provide the necessary expertise for the Gnosis Chain. Continued investment in\
  \ Nethermind’s work ensures that Gnosis Chain remains aligned with Ethereum’s technical\
  \ roadmap, maintains a highly performant execution layer, and benefits from leading\
  \ client and testing infrastructure. This partnership enables Gnosis to prioritize\
  \ resilience, innovation, and seamless network upgrades without compromising stability\
  \ or decentralization.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNethermind has proven itself as a key\
  \ infrastructure partner of Gnosis. This proposal aims to continue the partnership\
  \ to maintain Gnosis Chain and ensure it remains robust and aligned with the Ethereum\
  \ roadmap.\n\nProposal submitted by:\n\nMarek Moraczyński (Head of Blockchain Engineering)\
