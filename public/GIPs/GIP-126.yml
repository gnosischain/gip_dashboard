  \ With Nethermind for Gnosis Chain Maintenance?\nauthor: Marek Moraczyński, Alvin\
  \ Su\ntype: Funding\ncreated: 2025-06-06\nduration: ongoing\nfunding: 750,000 DAI\

  \ Simple Summary\nNethermind has established a partnership with Gnosis through[\
  \ GIP-47](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-47-should-gnosisdao-pass-a-grant-proposal-to-form-a-long-term-partnership-with-nethermind-gnosis-chains-primary-node/5074).\
  \ This proposal renews the long-term strategic collaboration with Nethermind for\
  \ the continued maintenance and development of the Gnosis Chain. Nethermind has\
  \ consistently demonstrated responsibility for the chain’s security, stability,\
  \ and alignment with the Ethereum roadmap, extending far beyond the scope of a single\
  \ client implementation.\nIf approved, GnosisDAO will allocate 750,000 DAI in the\
  \ first year, starting in June 2025, with annual increases of 4% to fund Nethermind’s\
  \ ongoing contributions.\n##  Motivation\nNethermind is a high-performance, .NET\
  \ based Ethereum Execution Client that has played a foundational role in the development\
  \ of the Gnosis Chain. Known for its reliable synchronization, efficient block processing,\
  \ and robust plugin architecture, the Nethermind client consistently delivers utility\
  \ and stability.\nOver the past few years, Nethermind has evolved from being solely\
  \ a client provider to becoming a core contributor across many aspects of the Gnosis\
  \ Chain infrastructure. This includes serving as the supermajority client and supporting\
  \ DevOps, testing, and research. As the Gnosis Chain continues to be a critical\
  \ piece of infrastructure, Nethermind remains crucial for its ongoing development\
  \ and long-term success.\n## Past Contributions\nNethermind has played a crucial\
  \ role in ensuring the reliable and stable operation of the Gnosis Chain. Nethermind\
  \ has delivered on the promises from[ GIP-47](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-47-should-gnosisdao-pass-a-grant-proposal-to-form-a-long-term-partnership-with-nethermind-gnosis-chains-primary-node/5074),\
  \ some of them were reprioritized and changed with other ones. Moreover, the Nethermind\
  \ team has contributed to more areas than originally outlined in GIP-47. Nethermind\
  \ has contributed to the following areas:\n* **Hardforks**: The Nethermind team,\
  \ in collaboration with Gnosis, has successfully navigated multiple hardforks. Nethermind\
  \ has never been limited to client development alone, but has also taken full ownership\
  \ of all testing related to hardforks. The team was responsible for testing and\
  \ ensuring that all upgrades ran smoothly. With The Merge, Gnosis Chain was migrated\
  \ from AuRa consensus to PoS, with Nethermind being the sole client that went through\
  \ the transition. During Shapella, Gnosis Chain introduced withdrawals. The Dencun\
  \ and Pectra hardforks on Gnosis Chain were delivered before their activation on\
  \ the Ethereum mainnet. All of these hardforks were delivered with such quality\
  \ that the chain, users, and node runners did not experience a single major issue.\n\
  * **Client Improvements:** Over the past three years, Nethermind has made significant\
  \ advancements. The Nethermind client is fully ready to scale Gnosis Chain without\
  \ sacrificing decentralization. This progress is visible in its adoption on the\
  \ Ethereum Mainnet. Nethermind was initially used by only 1–3% of nodes on Ethereum,\
  \ but now plays an important role in Ethereum client diversity, running on[ at least\
  \ 29.3% of Ethereum validators](https://supermajority.info/). During these years,\
  \ Nethermind team has made countless improvements across many areas such as the\
  \ general performance, stability of the client, JSON-RPC, health checks, plugin\
  \ architecture, state DB layout, and pruning. Gnosis Chain can also benefit from\
  \ super-fast snap-sync.\n* **Chain Health & Client Stability:** As the supermajority\
  \ client on Gnosis Chain, Nethermind has played a key role in maintaining the network’s\
  \ safety and stability over the years. Gnosis Chain has experienced no downtime,\
  \ and all significant issues have been promptly addressed in close collaboration\
  \ with the Gnosis team. Furthermore, Nethermind has actively supported efforts to\
  \ onboard additional execution clients to the Gnosis Chain.\n* **DevOps & Infrastructure:**\
  \ Nethermind has initiated and managed all networks used for testing, including\
  \ devnets and shadow forks. Additionally, the Nethermind team set up the Chiado\
  \ network and previously maintained the majority of its validators. Currently, Nethermind\
  \ maintains 30% of the Chiado validators.\n* **Encrypted Mempools:** Nethermind\
  \ delivered the first encrypted mempool implementation in its client using the Shutter\
  \ protocol, bringing censorship resistance and frontrunning protection to Gnosis\
  \ Chain. The team has contributed to the specification, implementation, and ongoing\
  \ research efforts that help shape its roadmap.\n* **Testing & Tooling:** The team\
  \ has been working on adopting a variety of testing tools and repositories for use\
  \ on Gnosis Chain. This includes tools and repositories such as[ Hive](https://github.com/gnosischain/hive),[\
  \ t8n](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/tree/master/tools/Evm),[ EEST](https://github.com/dmitriy-b/execution-spec-tests-gnosis),[\
  \ consensus-specs](https://github.com/dmitriy-b/consensus-specs). The goal of these\
  \ efforts is to ensure that network-specific features (for example base fee collector,\
  \ and withdrawals) are tested with Ethereum Mainnet-level quality. This also facilitates\
  \ the onboarding of other clients. Additionally, the team has implemented monitoring\
  \ for Hive tests and maintains a page displaying[ hive tests results](https://hive-gno.nethermind.io/#summary-sort=name).\n\
  ## Scope of Work & Team\nNethermind proposes to continue supporting and improving\
  \ the Gnosis Chain and the broader ecosystem. The main goal of this proposal is\
  \ to ensure the continued maintenance of the Gnosis Chain. The scope of work includes:\n\
  * Maintaining the Nethermind Client as a performant and reliable execution client\
  \ on the Gnosis Chain.\n* Delivering changes from the Ethereum roadmap in a timely\
  \ manner. This includes adopting Ethereum mainnet upgrades to the Gnosis Chain when\
  \ necessary. As an ongoing agreement this includes all future hardforks. In the\
  \ near term, the current focus will be:\n  * Fusaka – the upcoming hard fork for\
  \ both Ethereum and Gnosis Chain\n  * Glamsterdam – the subsequent hard fork\n \
  \ * History expiry – which aims to reduce disk requirements for node operators\n\
  \  * Statelessness – an ongoing effort; the direction has recently shifted from\
  \ Verkle tries to binary tries, with binary tries currently being prototyped\n*\
  \ Continuously improve the client’s ability to handle higher throughput, optimize\
  \ disk usage, and enhance synchronization performance.\n* Maintain the encrypted\
  \ mempool solution.\n* Develop, adopt and maintain custom EIPs required by the Gnosis\
  \ Chain.\n* Optimize the design of the Nethermind archive node to reduce storage\
  \ requirements.\n* Assist with adopting Ethereum testing infrastructure for Gnosis\
  \ (e.g., hive, t8n, EEST) and extend it to support Gnosis Chain–specific features.\n\
  * Support hardfork testing, including devnets, Kurtosis setups, and shadow forks.\n\
  * Continue maintaining Chiado and other critical infrastructure.\nThe broader Nethermind\
  \ core team comprises over 20 engineers contributing to both the Gnosis Chain and\
  \ Ethereum Mainnet. For Gnosis Chain, Nethermind allocates a dedicated subset of\
  \ engineers based on shifting priorities and workload demands. The number of team\
  \ members, including engineers, testers, DevOps specialists, and support staff,\
  \ varies over time and can scale up during major upgrades or critical initiatives.\
  \ This dynamic approach ensures efficient resource allocation while reinforcing\
  \ Nethermind’s strong commitment to the stability, seamless upgrades, and continuous\
  \ development of the Gnosis Chain.\n## Funding Request:\nThis proposal seeks to\
  \ renew the previous grant to enable Nethermind to continue its commitment to and\
  \ maintenance of the Gnosis Chain.\nAn ongoing grant of 750,000 DAI is requested\
  \ for the first year, starting in June 2025, with a 4% increase each subsequent\
  \ year.\nPayments to be made at the beginning of each quarter, first payment in\
  \ June 2025.\nThis funding will enable the Nethermind team to maintain its current\
  \ structure and provide the necessary expertise for the Gnosis Chain. Continued\
  \ investment in Nethermind’s work ensures that Gnosis Chain remains aligned with\
  \ Ethereum’s technical roadmap, maintains a highly performant execution layer, and\
  \ benefits from leading client and testing infrastructure. This partnership enables\
  \ Gnosis to prioritize resilience, innovation, and seamless network upgrades without\
  \ compromising stability or decentralization.\n## Conclusion\nNethermind has proven\
  \ itself as a key infrastructure partner of Gnosis. This proposal aims to continue\
  \ the partnership to maintain Gnosis Chain and ensure it remains robust and aligned\
  \ with the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nProposal submitted by:\nMarek Moraczyński (Head\
  \ of Blockchain Engineering) @marekm25, Alvin Su (Chief Commercial Officer) @alvinsu\n\
