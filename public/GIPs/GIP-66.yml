title: Should GnosisDAO sponsor The DAOist Bogota?
body: "The DAOist Bogota will be an event on Sunday, October 9th that will kickoff\
  \ Devcon week. This time we will go for our biggest, most ambitious DAOist event\
  \ yet aiming to have up to 1400 attendees.\n\n**If you're interested in supporting\
  \ this proposal, please submit your vote ASAP so that the DAOist can include GnosisDAO\
  \ as a sponsor in the deliverables in time** \n\nAs “The DAO chain”, Gnosis Chain\
  \ is invited to participate as sponsors for this event contributing also through\
  \ talks and/or workshops from contributors that will be joining us in Colombia this\
  \ year.\n\nIn the past, different DAOs that live in the Gnosis Chain, as well as\
  \ Gnosis itself, have participated in the Paris, Lisbon, Mexico City & Amsterdam\
  \ editions of The DAOist. This is an opportunity to reaffirm why Gnosis Chain is\
  \ a great home and neighborhood for current, new and future DAOs.\n\nBased on community\
  \ signaling, for $11,000 USD GnosisDAO would be getting the following benefits from\
  \ the Ride or DAO tier:\n* Talk Slot\n* Online & Print visibility\n* 8 tickets -\
  \ All inclusive\n* 1 Summoner Swag Bags\n\nThe DAOist Bogota will happen on Sunday,\
  \ October 9th, 2022. A talk has been suggested by @Jahed on “How DAOs can use the\
  \ pattern library and what mistakes it can help them avoid”."
