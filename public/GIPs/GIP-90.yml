title: Should Gnosis.eth update its ENS resolver to resolve .GNO domains on Gnosis
  Chain?
body: "### Executive Summary ###\n\n.GNO domains is launching on Gnosis Chain, with\
  \ one of the key features being a CCIP resolver that resolves .GNO domains on ENS.\
  \ For this to be implemented gnosis.eth is required to update its resolver to the\
  \ new CCIP resolver being developed.\n\n### Introduction ###\nWe at Gnosis have\
  \ been working with SpaceID, and DM3 protocol to bring .GNO domains to Gnosis. We\
  \ call it Genome.\n\nGenome’s mission is to create a digital-ID product centered\
  \ around .GNO domains, integrating the communities, dApps, and utilities native\
  \ to Gnosis chain as well as linking .GNO domains with ENS.\n\n### Product Features:\
  \ ###\n\n- .GNO domains integrated with the Gnosis ecosystem\n- Genome .GNO NFT\
  \ collection native to Gnosis\n- Developing a CCIP resolver enabling .GNO domains\
  \ to be resolved on Ethereum via ENS\n- .GNO Integration with current and future\
  \ JV (Space-ID) partners\n\nGenome is live on testnet! https://test.genomedomains.com/\
  \ \n\nENS Resolver Features:\n\nENS defines this standard where an example.eth address\
  \ can issue text.example.eth on Layer 2 (or another Layer 1 like Gnosis Chain).\
  \ With no or minimal trust assumptions. \n\nENS’ explainer on CCIP: https://docs.ens.domains/dapp-developer-guide/ens-l2-offchain\n\
  Our CCIP resolver in this case: https://github.com/dm3-org/genome-ccip-resolver\
  \ (only deployed on Gnosis testnet so far)\n\nNow, each example.gnosis.eth subdomain\
  \ will also have an example.gno domain. Those are centrally managed by Space-ID.\n\
  \nBoth are linked.\n\n.gno is resolved via https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-name-sdk/core\n\
  \n.gnosis.eth is resolved via an up-to-date version of ethersjs for example.\n\n\
  When I enter example.gnosis.eth in metamask - for example - the CCIP resolver contract\
  \ returns a URL to a CCIP-Read client like ethers.js. This URL can be used to perform\
  \ an off-chain lookup instead of fetching the records from the contract directly.\n\
  \nWhen calling the URL, the Gateway resolves the request by using the Gnosis RPC\
  \ provider to query the data from the SpaceId contract on the Gnosis Chain. The\
  \ data returned is signed by the gateway and then returned to the Read Client. To\
  \ add additional security, the gateway signs the response before, so only “trusted”\
  \ gateways can be used\n\n### Impact and Benefits ###\nThe main goal of Genome and\
  \ .GNO domains is increasing ease of access to new and existing users alike. With\
  \ the increasing costs of building on Ethereum, allowing .GNO domains to resolve\
  \ on ENS not only lowers costs for owning a domain but also opens up a new set of\
  \ possibilities for experimentation.\n\n### Proposed Changes / Implementation Plan\
  \ ###\nENS records for gnosis.eth need to be updated to set the resolver to Genome’s\
  \ resolver address 0xc9bf092673b3a066df088a2a911e23e9b69b82f2\n( https://github.com/dm3-org/genome-ccip-resolver\
