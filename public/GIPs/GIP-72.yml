title: Should GnosisDAO fund Common Ground to support onboarding DAOs to the Gnosis
  Chain Ecosystem?
body: "## Simple Summary\nThis proposal would fund [Common Ground](https://www.commonground.cg/),\
  \ the all-in-one communication & governance platform for DAOs & Communities. Built\
  \ as a public good, Common Ground supports the onboarding of DAOs and web3 communities\
  \ to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\n## Abstract\nIn May 2022, Common Ground launched\
  \ a closed alpha that onboarded over 90 communities by now including MetaCartel\
  \ Ventures DAO, Radicle, Giveth, and Outlier Ventures. These communities selected\
  \ us to provide their members with a more secure, web3 native communication and\
  \ coordination platform. \n\nWe are uniquely positioned to introduce DAOs and web3\
  \ communities to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem. Our current and future features like\
  \ token-gating, on-chain governance voting, and token issuance act as entry points\
  \ for the Gnosis Chain ecosystem. We recently bridged our Governance Token to Gnosis\
  \ Chain to reduce transaction costs and improve speed. In the coming months, we\
  \ plan to launch a public beta of our badge system that could be a great introduction\
  \ to a more formal Gnosis Chain integration on Common Ground.\n\nTest the closed\
  \ alpha yourself with [this referral link](https://app.commonground.cg/?ref=gnosis)\n\
  Common Ground will enter public alpha soon™\n\nWe are seeking a USD 50,000 grant\
  \ from GnosisDAO to further support onboarding DAOs and web3 communities to Gnosis\
  \ Chain by making it the default EVM in all our web3 tooling features. Our goal\
  \ is to establish trust and build our track record with GnosisDAO to explore larger\
  \ opportunities in the future.\n\n## Motivation/Rationale\nEvery web3 community\
  \ relies on communication and coordination to accomplish its goals in a decentralized\
  \ manner. The core of these activities occur on web2 platforms that are not designed\
  \ for web3 use cases. \n\nWe built Common Ground to address three core communication\
  \ and coordination pain points that web3 communities face:\n\n* Web3 native: Our\
  \ platform is built for web3 communities and their members. We plan to integrate\
  \ WalletConnect into our platform so communities can implement features like token-gating,\
  \ on-chain governance votes, token issuances, and airdrops. Members can craft their\
  \ profiles by connecting multiple wallets, showcasing their NFT collection, and\
  \ building their on-chain reputations. \n\n* Security: Community and user safety\
  \ is one of the top priorities for our platform. We introduced core features like\
  \ token-gating so communities don’t need to install bots and third-party apps. We\
  \ also introduced the concept of “human-gating” which allows communities to restrict\
  \ read or write-access to channels to verified humans. Users may opt to verify as\
  \ a human through our partnership with Fractal. This functionality unlocks our ability\
  \ to develop a full-grown Web of Trust that ensures the integrity of all social\
  \ interaction on our platform and can be utilized by other projects in the Gnosis\
  \ ecosystem.\n\n* Onboarding: Communities thrive when they have a frictionless,\
  \ user-friendly onboarding experience. We built our own content management system\
  \ to allow communities to create content flows catered to onboarding, announcements,\
  \ and more. Current and prospective members can easily read the latest announcement\
  \ as well as in-depth articles, learn more about the community, and rapidly onboard\
  \ without searching across multiple platforms for information. \n\nThese core features\
  \ are why web3 communities love our platform and will use our platform for on-chain\
  \ activities like token issuance, governance voting, and airdrops. Our comprehensive\
  \ communication and coordination platform stands to introduce communities to Gnosis\
  \ Chain, Safe, and the broader Gnosis ecosystem. \n\n### **How Common Ground Onboards\
  \ DAOs to Gnosis Chain Ecosystem**\nCommon Ground creates multiple opportunities\
  \ to drive awareness and onboard communities to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem. Currently,\
  \ our governance token and token-gating feature introduce communities and users\
  \ to Gnosis Chain. In the future, our on-chain governance voting, token issuance,\
  \ and more will drive communities directly to Gnosis Chain. \n\nCurrently, a major\
  \ part of the liquid supply of our governance and fee tokens is maintained on Gnosis\
  \ Chain. We are also already issuing our community governance NFTs on Gnosis Chain.\
  \ As we continue to develop our platform and require it for many on-chain transactions,\
  \ communities and their members will discover Gnosis Chain. This serves as one of\
  \ the earliest touch points into the Gnosis ecosystem. \n\nIn the future, these\
  \ are three of the major paths we envision that will onboard communities and DAOs\
  \ into the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\n#### Web3 Communities\nCommunities are the\
  \ precursor for many successful DAOs. As more and more communities explore the power\
  \ of web3 and DAOs, they will look for guidance and tooling that frictionlessly\
  \ onboard them. We’re building Common Ground with this major use case in mind by\
  \ developing tooling for companies to easily launch a governance token, implement\
  \ on-chain voting, and handle mass airdrops to existing members. \n\nCommon Ground\
  \ is positioned to be the trusted source to transition communities into DAOs as\
  \ the communication and coordination layer for them. In all our tooling, we can\
  \ place Gnosis Chain as the default EVM that will drive awareness and adoption of\
  \ Gnosis Chain. Our communities will appreciate the low transaction fees, high speeds,\
  \ and safe bridging onto Gnosis Chain. This will likely motivate them to explore\
  \ the Gnosis ecosystem further.\n\n#### Existing DAOs\nCommon Ground addresses some\
  \ of the core pain points that growing DAOs experience – onboarding, on-chain governance\
  \ voting, and security. These features attracted our core user base for our closed\
  \ alpha and contribute to consistent applications for our closed alpha. As DAOs\
  \ continue to adopt our platform, we have the opportunity to introduce and onboard\
  \ them to Gnosis Chain. \n\nDAOs strive for on-chain governance but hesitate due\
  \ to Mainnet transaction costs. Our future governance feature allows DAOs to streamline\
  \ on-chain voting and improve engagement while reducing transaction costs by leveraging\
  \ secondary chains. This is one of the key areas where we can onboard DAOs into\
  \ the Gnosis Chain ecosystem. We can place Gnosis Chain as the default EVM to make\
  \ use seamless. \n\nCommon Ground serves as an onboarding platform for the Gnosis\
  \ Chain Ecosystem. Our tooling introduces and onboards communities and DAOs seamlessly.\
  \ We have the ability to raise awareness and grow the DAO community on Gnosis Chain.\n\
  \n#### Web2 Communities & Users\nThere are hundreds of thousands of communities\
  \ that may investigate more formal governance and DAO structures in the future.\
  \ We want to make onboarding these communities seamless by developing a knowledge\
  \ repository about web3 that features helpful articles, how-to videos, and more.\
  \ \n\nCommon Ground would feature Gnosis Chain as the default chain in its educational\
  \ articles and how-to videos. This would introduce communities to the Gnosis ecosystem\
  \ to drive the adoption of Gnosis Chain, Safe, and more.\n\n## Specification\nCommon\
  \ Ground will deliver governance and token issuance features to support onboarding\
  \ communities and DAOs onto Gnosis Chain. We will place Gnosis Chain as the default\
  \ EVM for each of these features.\n\n#### Deliverable #1: Integrated Governance\

  \ will be managed and deployed by the Common Ground DAO multi-sig wallet. The signers\
  \ on the wallet are the board members of the Common Ground Association as well as\
  \ trusted core team members. Leftover funds will be deployed towards general improvements\
  \ of the overall platform in terms of security, scalability and useability."
