title: Should Pluser integrate Gnosis Chain in MVP?
body: "##  Authorization via Seed\n\nTo manage your wallet, you need to store your\
  \ seed phrase securely. The seed phrase is a complex way of authorization. If a\
  \ user loses their seed, they lose their account and assets.\n\n##  One seed for\
  \ all devices\n\nUsers can’t control access between devices. If a user has lost\
  \ their device, they can not block it from the account. Whoever gains access to\
  \ the device can access the user’s account. Therefore, the only option is to create\
  \ a new wallet and withdraw all assets there as soon as possible.\n\n##  Weak Security\n\
  \nCurrently, security is the responsibility of the user. If the user encounters\
  \ an insecure application, he may lose all his assets.\n\n##  No 2FA\n\nIf a user\
  \ encounters a hacker attack, there is no two-factor authentication for defending\
  \ the user’s account.\n\n#  Solution\n\n![Solution Solution1600×900 18.3 KB ]( \"\
  Solution\")\n\nPluser is a single account for all web3 apps with authorization via\
  \ email, decentralized 2FA, device manager, and hack protection.\n\nThe user can\
  \ use any web3 application and not worry about security. We thought of everything\
  \ for them. Now they never lose their crypto, NFT, etc. Our solution is entirely\
  \ decentralized, convenient, and secure. It consists of several parts.\n\n##  Authorization\
  \ via email\n\nUsers create an account and recover access to an account using email\
  \ and password. It’s simple, and users will never lose access to their accounts.\n\
  \n##  Device manager\n\nUsers can manage access for each device. If a user loses\
  \ their device, they can revoke access.\n\n##  Hack Protection\n\nIf a user uses\
  \ an unsafe web3 app, Pluser will notify the user about it and block this app.\n\
  \n##  Decentralized 2FA\n\nIf hackers attack a user’s account, 2FA will protect\
  \ it.\n\n#  Web2/Web3\n\nPluser is a simple and secure way to use web3 applications.\
  \ It’s like **Google Account/Apple ID** but in web3.\n\n![Web2/Web3 Web2/Web31600×900\

  \ It will also help onboarding users from web2.\n\n##  GnosisDAO Snapshot\n\n_Phase\
