title: Should GnosisDAO fund Dark Forest DAO for Arena game mode on Gnosis Optimism?
body: 'Dark Forest DAO (dfdao) is a team of developers and players that have been
  building on top of Dark Forest, an open-source, web3 game.


  We reached an agreement with the former xDAI team in mid-April to fund four months
  of development (April - July) to build a new game mode of Dark Forest on Gnosis
  Optimism.


  The payment was in two phases: Phase 1 was the development of the new game mode.
  Phase 2 is hosting competitions and stress testing Gnosis Optimism.


  The xDAI team paid us for Phase 1, but disbanded as part of the Gnosis merger before
  paying us for Phase 2. This proposal is to request payment of $159,000 from GnosisDAO
  for Phase 2 of our work, due to the xDAI / Gnosis merger.


  Please reference the GIP-55 post on the Gnosis Forum for more information.'
