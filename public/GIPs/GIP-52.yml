title: Should former xDai team be involved in future Gnosis Chain development?
body: 'The former xDAI team has been instrumental in the operations and the success
  of Gnosis Chain. We see big value in continuing with the team, which has accumulated
  extraordinary knowledge about the technology and ecosystem of the Gnosis Chain.


  We propose to use the funds of the former xDAI ecosystem fund (https://etherscan.io/address/0x5e78c09984bd6608f8e913f0924062c043ed6ad7)
  to fund the team to contribute to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem in various ways described
  in the temperature check proposal:
