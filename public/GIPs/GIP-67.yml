title: Should GnosisDAO fund Gnosis (chain) Ecosystem Analysis and Dashboard?
body: 'Simple Summary

  To create an in-depth Ecosystem Report and Live Ecosystem Dashboard that helps attract
  new resources to Gnosis and improve resource coordination among existing stakeholders.


  Abstract

  To improve resource coordination and allocation within the Gnosis ecosystem, GnosisDAO
  should fund the creation of a curated overview and ecosystem dashboard. This will
  improve navigation of the Gnosis ecosystem and fast-track decision-making (such
  as investments, grants, partnerships, business development, and more). A curated
  Gnosis overview based on an in-depth analysis of its key players will strongly improve
  the UX and navigation of projects building on the Gnosis chain.


  Motivation

  The Gnosis ecosystem evaluation and dashboard aim to improve UX for new joiners
  and longstanding contributors. It will speed up decision-making and coordination
  by improving the navigation of the space through a curated ecosystem overview. This
  will also enable new features, such as sorting all projects by a rating score. Thus
  users can easily find projects that fulfill their needs and match their level of
  interest or risk appetite.


  Making it easier for Gnosis stakeholders to understand and navigate all projects
  on Gnosis will save a lot of time and resources related to due diligence and decision-making.


  The report and dashboard can also be used as a starting point for a potential GnosisDAO
  Ecosystem Fund or any other Grants/Builder program. Moreover, it can be used as
  a benchmark to follow the developments and improvements and uncover gaps.


  Specification

  The program will start with an ecosystem mapping and methodology improvement facilitated
  by two top-raters of Prime Rating (rank Master 1 or higher). An updated version
  of the current review framework will be made to match the Gnosis context, and a
  list of all projects on Gnosis with research priorities will be created.


  After the pre-research, the Prime Rating team will host two seasons (rating contests)
  in collaboration with Gnosis community members to evaluate at least 40+ projects
  on Gnosis. During these events, analysts can get rewarded with DAI, GNO, and D2D
  for reviewing the Gnosis ecosystem.


  From this research, two resources will be created, namely:


  An Ecosystem Report - An easily digestible report that showcases the existing ecosystem
  (from tech to projects built on the Gnosis chain and identifies potential areas
  for improvement to expand the ecosystem). The report can be used by users, builders,
  and funders alike to speed up their decision-making.


  The Gnosis Dashboard - A web application that provides an overview of all projects
  on Gnosis that can be reviewed using our methodologies with a letter score based
  on a proven methodology, analyzing the quality of key attributes of each project
  (including team, governance, tokenomics, value-proposition and more). The Dashboard
  will be tailored to Gnosis and hosted on a Gnosis-native domain. An example of a
  dashboard can be found here 3.


  Review Methodology and Process

  The project will be executed by Prime Rating, an analyst collective with over 50+
  contributors that operates as an independent sub-DAO of PrimeDAO. Since early 2021,
  Prime Rating has created multiple frameworks to evaluate projects and ecosystems
  with over 200+ reports created by 60+ individuals and successful projects executed
  with Celo, 1kx, Kyber, and Metaportal. It has a partnership with leading research
  group DeFi Safety which provides the technical review, whereby Prime Rating focuses
  primarily on the fundamental side.


  Prime Rating operates as a DAO - where reports are created by analysts and reviewed
  by experienced DAO members in a Web 3.0 native way - allowing for native ecosystem
  members to learn, level up, and earn rewards. Analysts in Prime Rating earn a rank
  by successfully submitting reports accepted via governance, which is manifested
  as on-chain reputation, thus representing their experience.

  The current review framework includes DeFi, Metaverse, and ReFi and provides deep
  insights into the reviewed projects. This is then translated into a letter score,
  representing the overall quality of a project.


  Implementation

  Timeline and Budget


  Within 4 weeks of this proposal passing, the top raters of Prime Rating (rank Master
  or higher) will create an ecosystem map to ensure a clear overview of the current
  Gnosis ecosystem. Based on this preliminary research, an updated version of the
  current review framework will be made to match the Gnosis context, and a list of
  all projects on Gnosis with research priorities will be created.

  Within 12 weeks of the completion of the pre-research, the Prime Rating team will
  host two seasons (each 5-week long rating contests) with existing raters and Gnosis
  community members to analyze at least 40+ projects building on Gnosis. During these
  events, analysts can get rewarded with DAI, GNO, and D2D for reviewing the Gnosis
  Ecosystem.

  Within 4 weeks of the completion of the events, the Prime Rating team will create
  a live dashboard similar to the current Rating Dashboard 3 to be hosted on a Gnosis
  native domain such as ecosystem.gnosis.io 2

  Within 6 weeks of the completion of the rate-athons, the top raters will create,
  design, and publish an ecosystem report with key insights gained during reviewing
  the projects.


  GnosisDAO will provide 58,500 DAI + 400 GNO to Prime Rating to run the full program
  within 18 weeks of this proposal passing. Received funds to be managed by the Prime
  Rating multisig at primerating.eth. Rewards to be allocated on Gnosis Chain.


  Fund Allocation Details

  Below is a breakdown of the expected spending of the budget based on previous campaigns.


  Preliminary research phase: 8,000 DAI + 40 GNO for three weeks of research by two
  top raters.

  Rating Season: 15,500 DAI + 200 GNO to be distributed to analysts and reviewers
  (expected to be split between 15+ individuals)

  Ecosystem Report: 10,000 DAI + 60 GNO for four weeks of research by two high-level
  raters

  Dashboard: 7,500 DAI + 25 GNO to design, develop and host the Ecosystem Dashboard
  on a Gnosis native domain.

  Program Management: 12,500 DAI + 75 GNO for 5 weeks of program management

  Marketing: 5,000 DAI to support marketing and design efforts and purchase media
  to support the rate-athon and report.

  Total: 58,500 DAI + 400 GNO


  All rewards will be allocated on Gnosis Chain to promote usage.'
