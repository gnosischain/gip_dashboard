title: Adopt Participation Agreement
body: "### SIMPLE SUMMARY\n\nThis is a proposal to implement a private ordering agreement\
  \ (a so-called “Participation Agreement”) among all GnosisDAO participants to provide\
  \ an operating framework for the GnosisDAO and to govern the rights and obligations\
  \ of each party.\n\n### ABSTRACT\n\nThe participation agreement:\n- explains the\
  \ GnosisDAO’s governance mechanism and determines who GnosisDAO participants are.\n\
  - provides a mutual release by DAO participants from claims arising out of or in\
  \ connection with the GnosisDAO and a mutual waiver of claims against the GnosisDAO\
  \ and other DAO participants.\n- limits the liability of the GnosisDAO, the service\
  \ providers, Gnosis Limited, and the signers in relation to loss or damage arising\
  \ under or in connection with the use of GnosisDAO smart contracts.\n- provides\
  \ a complaints and dispute resolution procedure.\n\n### MOTIVATION\n\nAs a DAO that\
  \ is not wrapped within a legacy system legal entity, it is paramount to minimize\
  \ the legal risks to GnosisDAO participants as much as possible.\n\n### SPECIFICATION\n\
  \n[Proposed Participation Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HzK3VbOJ3MLllimKquT-SPnL81lx7n1BKEOwq1hW1hE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\
  \n### RATIONALE\n\nThe GnosisDAO is a decentralised collective stewarding a growing\
  \ ecosystem by developing and dogfooding the operating system for Ethereum and is\
  \ governed by, and returns value to, the GNO token holders. It relies on the Gnosis\
  \ Safe Multisig smart contracts and Gnosis Zodiac modules for DAO governance to\
  \ enable transparent governance by the GNO token holders to manage the GnosisDAO\
  \ and control resources transparently. Although the GnosisDAO was seeded by Gnosis\
  \ Limited, Gnosis Limited has relinquished all control over the GnosisDAO. It is\
  \ participant managed, and does not have any director or manager. No single party\
  \ is in control. \n\nAs the GnosisDAO exists entirely on-chain, jurisdiction may\
  \ not recognise it as an entity with legal personality or limited liability. While\
  \ efforts are underway (notably in Wyoming, Malta and by COALA, who have been drafting\
  \ a DAO Model Law), unincorporated DAOs do not operate as persons within the eyes\
  \ of the law.\n\nThe attempted shoehorning of DAOs by legal systems into existing\
  \ categories such as unregistered organisations, unincorporated associations or\
  \ general partnerships leads to concerns that DAO participants may be held liable\
  \ for the actions of the DAO. While GnosisDAO Participants cannot dictate states\
  \ and state regulators how to characterise the GnosisDAO, we should use whatever\
  \ private law mechanism at our disposal to frame the GnosisDAO as we see it and\
  \ minimize legal risks as much as possible to the GnosisDAO, GnosisDAO participants,\
  \ Gnosis Limited as the initial funder, service providers and the signers of the\
  \ GnosisDAO Safe multisig."
