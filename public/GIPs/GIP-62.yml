title: Should GnosisDAO Sponsor Prode Markets?
body: '# Simple Summary


  Prode is a decentralized betting platform built using Reality.eth and Kleros and
  currently deployed on Gnosis Chain. Unlike other projects like Omen or Azuro where
  1-question markets are created and supported by liquidity providers, Prode focuses
  on betting pools in which users bet on multiple outcomes and compete against each
  other for the highest prize. This is a very popular type of sports betting scheme
  that has been played across the world for many decades.


  Prode was officially launched 1 month ago after 4 months of intense work and without
  any external funding. To bootstrap the first markets and kickoff adoption of the
  platform, the Gnosis DAO could sponsor the most attractive markets in exchange for
  some of the creator''s fee rights of the markets chosen. Additionally Gnosis DAO
  could provide funding to the Prode team to support the project''s development and
  advertising. In exchange for the funds, Prode commits to giving GnosisDAO 100k USD
  worth of governance tokens once the Prode token is released.


  # Motivation


  1. Increase adoption of Gnosis Chain. We noticed that the onboarding of new users
  is an issue, because getting xDAI on Gnosis Chain for the first time is confusing
  and sometimes not very straightforward. There''s also a lot of competition among
  sidechains and L2s, and Gnosis Chain is not the most popular one.


  2. Attract users and market creators to Prode. In the type of prediction markets
  Prode focuses on, users usually look for markets with potentially big prizes (a
  bit like a lottery). Initially, this is hard to achieve, because the dapp traffic
  is low and therefore there are no market creators advertising their market pools,
  and vice versa. One of the strategies to overcome this is to start creating markets
  ourselves and fund them with juicy prizes.


  # Specification


  Total requested amount: 200k xDAI:


  * 100k for sponsoring markets.


  * 50k for the team.


  * 50k for marketing.


  ### Funds Allocation Details


  Sponsor the following markets (100k xDAI total):


  * FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. 20k xDAI. Creator fees (5%) will be used to incentivize
  the referral program within this market.


  * T20 Cricket World Cup 2022. 5k xDAI. Creator fees (5%) go to UBI Burner to support
  the UBI price and attract its community and supporters.


  * F1 Grand Prix Japan & Brazil. 2.5k xDAI each. Creator fees (5%) go to GnosisDAO.
  Breakeven*: 50k xDAI each.


  * League of Legends World Cup 2022. 5k xDAI. Creator fees (5%) go to GnosisDAO.
  Breakeven*: 100k xDAI.


  * CS:GO BLAST Premier: World Final 2022. 5k xDAI. Creator fees (5%) go to a public
  good project TBD.


  * Upcoming 30 weeks of the NBA. 15k xDAI evenly split into each week matches. Creator
  fees (5%) go to GnosisDAO. Breakeven*: 10k xDAI per market.


  * Upcoming 30 matchdays of the English Premier League. 30k xDAI evenly split into
  each matchday market. Creator fees (5%) go to each subsequent matchday market.


  * Upcoming 20 matchdays of the Argentinian football league. 5k xDAI evenly split
  into each matchday market. Creator fees (5%) go to UBI Burner to support the UBI
  price and attract its community and supporters.


  * 5k xDAI will be converted to bet vouchers and distributed to active Proof of Humanity
  users instead of used to directly sponsor a chosen market. This will be important
  for a couple of reasons. First, it will signal what markets are preferred (at least
  by an active ethereum community). Second, it will bring activity and promotion to
  Prode. Last, it will help onboard Ethereum Mainnet users to Gnosis Chain.


  * Similarly, 5k xDAI will be converted to bet vouchers and distributed to active
  bettors of Prode''s competitors, both from Gnosis Chain and other Chains.


  *The breakeven point refers to the market pool size needed to recover the funds.
  It could be lower if significant royalties are generated or if other sponsors fund
  the market; it could be greater if a lot of users bet in the markets through referral
  links. A bet placed after entering the market through a referral link will split
  the creator fees in halves: 50% to creator and 50% to referral.


  Team funding (50k xDAI). Although the team has been self-funding the project for
  the past 5 months and will continue to do so in the short term, this extra funding
  will allow the team to start working full-time on the project for the next 6 months.
  Prode is currently being developed by 3 devs from the Kleros community. Additionally,
  this funding would be enough to hire 2 interns for communication purposes and contract
  free-lancing design services for the front-end and Prode''s NFTs.


  Marketing funding (50k xDAI). Sponsoring markets alone is not enough to attract
  users to Gnosis Chain and Prode. The 50k USD requested will be used as follows:


  * ~15k xDAI will be used to partner with sports influencers/streamers/casters in
  order to promote Prode and its markets.


  * ~15k xDAI will be spent in traditional online advertising services.


  * Based on what is learned in the upcoming months, 20k xDAI will be used in 2023
  Q1 to (1) sponsor strategic markets and (2) explore markets we haven''t considered
  yet.


  ### PRODE Token


  The Prode protocol generates fees from each market. The team is in the process of
  designing a governance token that will allow holders to manage the DAO''s funds
  and control some protocol parameters. Once the token is released, GnosisDAO will
  receive 100k USD worth of PRODE tokens. The price taken into account to calculate
  the distribution will be equal to the cheapest price the tokens were sold at.


  # Rationale


  Prode markets tackle a prediction market niche that is currently unattended in the
  blockchain industry. On the other hand, most decentralized prediction markets platforms,
  which focus on single-event predictions, struggle to sufficiently incentivize liquidity
  providers. Prode markets don''t have this problem, because the prize pool is bootstrapped
  from bettors themselves. However, until Prode gets more popular and its market creator-bettor
  ecosystem consolidates, sponsoring key markets could help adoption greatly.


  A bettor who is not familiar with Gnosis Chain and Prode might not be attracted
  to the platform if the prize pools are low. If attractive markets such as the FIFA
  World Cup market gets a 25k USD funding, this would be a huge incentive for new
  users to join the network.


  2022 Q4 will be a time of very popular sport events. This is a huge opportunity
  to gain traction. Some examples:


  * According to FIFA ~150 bn USD worth of bets were made during the World Cup 2018
  held in Russia. We should try to capture some of this for the World Cup 2022.


  * Cricket is a very popular sport in Australia, India, Pakistan and England, which
  constitute very big and diverse markets. In october the cricket world cup will happen.


  * Esports have experienced a huge growth in the last decade and so have prizes and
  bets around its tournaments. People following esports - usually young, techy gamers
  - are a good fit for crypto/online bets, because they will deal better with the
  UX friction dapps have. There are some big tournaments coming and we should make
  the most of them.


  * While big events attract a lot of users, they happen only a few times a year at
  most. It''s also important to incentivize smaller markets that can be played on
  a regular basis and thus create engagement in the long run. Football leagues are
  a good opportunity to test this out.


  # Implementation


  Once this GIP gets approved, the ownership of the creator contracts of the markets
  mentioned above will be transferred to the GnosisDAO address on Gnosis Chain. Afterwards,
  either Prode''s team can administer the market funding on behalf of GnosisDAO or
  the GnosisDAO can fund the markets directly by calling fundMarket(""){value: sponsoredValue}
  in each market. These operational details will be discussed with the Karpatkey DAO
  team.


  5% of the pools'' xDAI, including the funds sponsored, will be rewarded to the creator
  address when the market closes. Additionally, if bets positions get traded in a
  secondary market that supports royalties, the creator address (GnosisDAO or UBI
  Burner) will receive 1.5% of trades as royalties.


  The 100k USD requested for development and marketing will be sent to the Prode''s
  multisig, which will administer the funds, on Gnosis Chain: 0x0029ec18568F96AFE25Ea289Dac6c4703868924d.
