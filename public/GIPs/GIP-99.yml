title: Should Gnosis Guild steward GnosisDAO Governance?
body: "## Category\n\nService Agreements\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nGnosis Guild proposes\
  \ to steward GnosisDAO governance, guiding a new phase of innovation, experimentation,\
  \ and growth. As GnosisDAO continues allocating resources to Gnosis Chain, Gnosis\
  \ Pay, and other mission-aligned ventures, our team will drive the DAO’s governance\
  \ strategy and operations through dedicated R&D, technical implementation, and ongoing\
  \ stewardship.\n\nWhile Gnosis Guild has been actively contributing to the maintenance\
  \ and improvement of GnosisDAO governance since its inception, this proposal will\
  \ formalize a long-term partnership that prioritizes the following objectives:\n\
  \n  * Improve, maintain, and secure GnosisDAO governance infrastructure.\n  * Foster\
  \ the growth and further decentralization of the Gnosis Ecosystem.\n  * Position\
  \ GnosisDAO as leading innovators of DAO governance.\n\n\n\nThrough these guiding\
  \ stars, Gnosis Guild will also address the challenges currently faced by GnosisDAO’s\
  \ governance. Initiatives includes: (1) designing a new governance architecture\
  \ and roadmap to tackle the operational inefficiency of its monolithic governance\
  \ patterns, (2) introducing novel funding mechanisms to address its inefficient\
  \ capital allocation and lackluster ecosystem development, and (3) progressively\
  \ decentralizing DAO processes to increase governance activity, transparency, and\
  \ participation.\n\nThe proposal will begin with an Initial Trial Period (ITP) that,\
  \ upon successful completion of its deliverables, will transition into a two year\
  \ workstream outlined below.\n\nOur funding request is $38k USDC + $38k GNO (priced\
  \ at the time the proposal passes and locked for one year), paid monthly to Gnosis\
  \ Guild.\n\n**About Gnosis Guild:** _Gnosis Guild is a web3-native venture studio\
  \ with the values of conviviality, co-ownership, and experimentation at its heart.\
  \ For over three years, our team’s modular tooling and needs-driven development\
  \ have secured and operationalized the GnosisDAO’s governance and treasury asset\
  \ management. These include: Zodiac Reality Module for decentralized Snapshot governance;\
  \ Zodiac Roles and bespoke tooling for karpatkey’s non-custodial asset management;\
  \ custom strategies for delegation; token locking and distribution systems for CoW\
  \ and Safe; and support and development for other GnosisDAO initiatives like Hashi\
  \ and Gnosis Pay._\n\n## Service Description\n\nGnosis Guild will guide GnosisDAO’s\
  \ governance through strategic R&D, technical implementation, and ongoing stewardship.\
  \ In response to community feedback and motivated by our commitment to needs-driven\
  \ development for the GnosisDAO, we have outlined objectives that will inform our\
  \ overarching governance strategy and initiatives that address key areas for improvement.\n\
  \n### Objectives:\n\n  1. **Improve, maintain, and secure GnosisDAO governance infrastructure.**\
  \  \n**Indicator:** Increased utility and adoption of GNO as a governance token\
  \ through enhanced voting participation and token utilization.\n\n  2. **Foster\
  \ the growth and further decentralization of the Gnosis Ecosystem.**  \n**Indicator:**\
  \ A thriving ecosystem with multiple transparent funding mechanisms and active engagement\
  \ from top-tier external contributors.\n\n  3. **Position GnosisDAO as leading innovators\
  \ of DAO governance.**  \n**Indicator:** Novel governance infrastructure and ongoing\
  \ initiatives to integrate emerging tech.\n\n\n\n\n### Key Performance Indicators:\n\
  \n  1. Improvement in annual total vote weight utilized\n  2. Improvement in annual\
  \ total voter turnout\n  3. Increased allocation of annual total resources per approved\
  \ proposals\n\n\n\nWe will use the consistent evaluation of these variables on an\
  \ ongoing basis to measure our impact on our outlined objectives. By measuring vote\
  \ weight utilization, voter turnout, and resource allocation, we can explicitly\
  \ measure governance engagement and implicitly measure proposal quality. While resource\
  \ allocation is inconsistently documented across proposals to date, we estimate\
  \ that an increase in the ratio of total proposed funds to allocated funds would\
  \ correlate with an increase in proposal approvals and quality. We will evaluate\
  \ each proposal individually, but due to the historically significant variation\
  \ in engagement between proposals, our KPIs will be measured on a yearly time period\
  \ to reflect macro trends. For example: from 2022 to 2023, there was a 73% decrease\
  \ in proposals generated, a 66% decrease in total voters, and a 79% decrease in\
  \ total vote weight utilized. While the causes of changes in governance engagement\
  \ are speculative, our intuition is that market dynamics, major events (xDai merger),\
  \ and governance stewardship were contributing factors.\n\n### Initiatives:\n\n\
  A new architecture and roadmap for governance\n\n  * Problem: GnosisDAO’s monolithic\
  \ governance pattern limits operational efficiency and innovative potential.\n \
  \ * Solution: Develop a new architecture and roadmap to enhance agility and innovation,\
  \ focused on multiple types of roles, organizational units, and parallel governance\
  \ processes.\n\n\n\nNovel funding mechanisms to foster the Gnosis Ecosystem\n\n\
  \  * Problem: Opaque ecosystem funding mechanisms hinder capital allocation and\
  \ ecosystem development.\n  * Solution: Implement novel funding mechanisms to scale\
  \ and grow the Gnosis Ecosystem, fostering transparency and capital efficiency.\
  \ Experiment with, and implement, mechanisms like futarchy or conviction voting\
  \ as parallel allocation methods.\n\n\n\nProgressive decentralization of DAO processes\n\
  \n  * Problem: Low governance participation reflects a perceived lack of value in\
  \ committing resources.\n  * Solution: Facilitate progressive decentralization of\
  \ DAO processes for greater resilience and trustlessness, creating a more automated,\
  \ efficient, and permissionless functioning for the DAO.\n\n\n\n### 1\\. Key aspects\n\
  \n**A new architecture and roadmap for governance**\n\nThe current governance process\
  \ only allows one path for DAO action, namely GIPs. This monolithic structure can\
  \ be very time consuming and involve significant risk on both the contributor and\
  \ DAO sides, along with implying high voter bandwidth. Creating multiple types of\
  \ roles, organizational units, and parallel governance processes within the DAO\
  \ will serve to decentralize decision-making, reduce bottlenecks, improve bandwidth,\
  \ and diversify the DAO’s ability to adapt and respond. Safe Guardians, OP Badge\
  \ Holders, and ENS working groups are a few examples. By effectively delegating\
  \ clearly scoped responsibilities to autonomous groups, GnosisDAO can improve its\
  \ organizational efficiency while reducing the governance overhead of its top layer\
  \ governance. We will develop an evolving architecture, with ongoing innovation\
  \ and experimentation, to remain agile to dynamic needs.\n\n**Novel funding mechanisms\
  \ to foster the Gnosis Ecosystem**\n\nTo scale and grow the Gnosis Ecosystem, we\
  \ will design and implement novel funding mechanisms for maximum capital efficiency.\
  \ Multiple paths to ecosystem funding would enable more autonomous contributions,\
  \ with clear directives and expectations. Optimism and Arbitrum have set an excellent\
  \ example here, and their ecosystem growth is a clear reflection. Frameworks like\
  \ RetroPGF, ARB’s STIP + multiple grants programs, and Safe’s OBRA are all promising\
  \ directions. Similarly, innovation in futarchy and conviction voting has shown\
  \ potential as emerging allocation mechanisms. Based on their successes and pitfalls,\
  \ we will develop our own mechanism suited to the Gnosis Ecosystem.\n\n**Progressive\
  \ decentralization of DAO processes**\n\nBy developing modular, composable DAO governance\
  \ processes, we will increase decentralization and transparency. In reducing any\
  \ single point of failure, the DAO will have greater resilience and trustlessness.\
  \ With the development of new onchain mechanisms, we will create a more automated,\
  \ efficient, and permissionless functioning for the DAO.\n\n### 2\\. Service Scope\n\
  \nThis proposal is solely for our work stewarding governance of GnosisDAO. Any additional\
  \ work, such as our contributions to Gnosis Pay, Hashi, and DAO treasury management,\
  \ would be out of scope.\n\n### 3\\. Service delivery\n\n**Immediate Improvements**\n\
  \n  * Modernize the GnosisDAO’s Snapshot strategy to correctly account for a greater\
  \ diversity of GNO holders.\n  * Enable key delegation features for the DAO: split\
  \ delegation, transitive delegation, and delegation term limits.\n  * Implement\
  \ spam proposal filtration\n\n\n\n**Research, Architecture, Design**\n\n  * Extensive\
  \ research of successful DAO governance architectures\n  * Continuous gathering\
  \ of GNO stakeholder feedback\n  * Iterative design of novel mechanisms for the\
  \ DAO’s operations\n  * Experimentation with parallel, tightly-scoped governance\
  \ mechanisms\n  * Development of a collaborative roadmap for the DAO’s evolution\n\
  \n\n\n**Technical Implementation**\n\n  * Full-stack and smart contract development\
  \ of governance tooling\n  * Implement novel governance technologies\n\n\n\n**Continuous\
  \ Stewardship and Operations**\n\n  * Management of DAO governance processes\n \
  \ * Coordination of calls, feedback, and calendar\n  * Active engagement in forum\
  \ to foster transparent, efficient dialogue\n  * Rapid response to emergent issues\
  \ and risks\n\n\n\n### 4\\. Support\n\nGnosis Guild will provide community technical\
  \ support and ensure we have a rapid response process to any high-risk issues related\
  \ to GnosisDAO governance.\n\n## Pricing and payment\n\nOur funding request is $38k\
  \ USDC + $38k GNO (priced at the time the proposal passes and locked for one year)\
  \ paid monthly to Gnosis Guild.\n\nThis would ensure we have a stable fiat payment\
  \ to sustain the pod through any downturns, while still providing Gnosis Guild with\
  \ a long-term incentive alignment for our work. The GNO portion would also have\
  \ a 1-year lockup from receipt.\n\nThe duration would be for 24 months, able to\
  \ be terminated at any time.\n\nThe team would be comprised of 3.5 guild members\
  \ including senior full-stack engineers, solidity engineers, mechanism designers,\
  \ governance leads, PM, researchers, comms, and ops as-needed. The typical team\
  \ will include 2 senior engineers, one PM/governance lead, and part-time comms/ops,\
  \ adjusting based on current projects. The total cost to GnosisDAO will remain competitive\
  \ with other top protocol DAOs.\n\nPayment Frequency | USDC Allocation | GNO Allocation\
  \  \n---|---|---  \nMonthly | $38k | $38k  \n  \n(using the price of GNO on the\
  \ date of proposal approval)|\n\n## Service Terms and Exit Strategy\n\nIf applicable\
  \ the duration of the service agreement. Please outline the terms and conditions\
  \ for exiting the service agreement, including the circumstances under which a party\
  \ may terminate the agreement, and any other important details.\n\nThe agreement\
  \ between service provider Gnosis Guild and organization GnosisDAO will take effect\
  \ immediately upon this proposal passing. The terms within the agreement will be\
  \ valid for two years, unless terminated by either party or updated with mutual\
  \ consent by both parties. GnosisDAO will assign specific permissions to Gnosis\
  \ Guild within their treasury utilizing the Roles Modifier to enable Gnosis Guild\
  \ to autonomously collect payment. Either party may terminate the agreement at any\
  \ time without cause by giving 90 days of written notice to the other party. Upon\
  \ termination, all outstanding payments shall be made by GnosisDAO to Gnosis Guild\
  \ prior to agreement on termination date.\n\n## Team/ Organization\n\nGnosis Guild\
  \ will act as an Autonomous Core Contributor for GnosisDAO. Through mutualistic\
  \ partnerships and activist R&D, our team of engineers, designers, and researchers\
  \ will foster the long-term development and sustainable growth of GnosisDAO’s network.\
  \ See our contributor list here.\n\n## Initial Trial Period\n\nThe proposal will\
  \ begin with an Initial Trial Period (ITP) that, upon successful completion of its\
  \ deliverables, will transition into the ongoing workstream outlined above. This\
  \ modification aims to offer more concrete test projects, addressing the feedback\
  \ from Martin and Thomas. The ITP will last 3 months and will carry out the following\
  \ projects:\n\n  1. Split and Transitive Delegation\n\n\n\nIntegration, support,\
  \ and maintenance of our improved Snapshot delegation dashboard and strategy, enabling\
  \ split delegation, transitive delegation, and delegation term limits.\n\n  * Split\
  \ Delegation: Accounts can delegate their vote weight to any number of other accounts,\
  \ along with assigning a specific percentage of their voting power to each. For\
  \ example, Alice could delegate 80% of their vote weight to Bob and 20% to Charlie.\
  \ Voters could also partially delegate to new mechanisms, like futarchy or agents,\
  \ as a test-site for new forms.\n  * Transitive Delegation: Accounts can delegate\
  \ not only their own vote weight, but also any vote weight delegated to them. For\
  \ example, if Alice delegates to Bob, and Bob delegates to Charlie, Charlie’s total\
  \ vote weight is the sum of the vote weights of Alice, Bob, and Charlie.\n  * Delegation\
  \ Term Limits: Accounts and Snapshot spaces can optionally set time limits on how\
  \ long any given delegation remains valid. Spaces can also choose which, if any,\
  \ term limit to respect when calculating vote weights.\n\n\n  2. GnosisDAO Treasury\
  \ Dashboard\n\n\n\nThere is currently no live view of the DAO treasury and its wide\
  \ range of investments. In order to increase transparency and better communicate\
  \ the value behind GNO, we will develop a dashboard that aggregates and tracks the\
  \ DAO treasury and its actively managed positions. This will include analytics,\
  \ charting functionality, open TWAP order tracking, metrics on yield, growth, spending,\
  \ revenue, and private investments that belong to the DAO.\n\n7 Likes\n\nGIP-101:\
