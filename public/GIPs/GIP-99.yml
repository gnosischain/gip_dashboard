title: Should Gnosis Guild steward GnosisDAO Governance?
body: "# GIP-99: Should Gnosis Guild steward GnosisDAO Governance?\n\n## Executive\
  \ Summary\n\nGnosis Guild proposes to steward GnosisDAO governance, guiding a new\
  \ phase of innovation, experimentation, and growth. As GnosisDAO continues allocating\
  \ resources to Gnosis Chain, Gnosis Pay, and other mission-aligned ventures, our\
  \ team will drive the DAO's governance strategy and operations through dedicated\
  \ R&D, technical implementation, and ongoing stewardship.\n\nWhile Gnosis Guild\
  \ has been actively contributing to the maintenance and improvement of GnosisDAO\
  \ governance since its inception, this proposal will formalize a long-term partnership\
  \ that prioritizes the following objectives:\n\n* Improve, maintain, and secure\
  \ GnosisDAO governance infrastructure.\n* Foster the growth and further decentralization\
  \ of the Gnosis Ecosystem.\n* Position GnosisDAO as leading innovators of DAO governance.\n\
  \nThrough these guiding stars, Gnosis Guild will also address the challenges currently\
  \ faced by GnosisDAO’s governance. Initiatives includes: (1) designing a new governance\
  \ architecture and roadmap to tackle the operational inefficiency of its monolithic\
  \ governance patterns, (2) introducing novel funding mechanisms to address its inefficient\
  \ capital allocation and lackluster ecosystem development, and (3) progressively\
  \ decentralizing DAO processes to increase governance activity, transparency, and\
  \ participation.\n\nThe proposal will begin with an Initial Trial Period (ITP) that,\
  \ upon successful completion of its deliverables, will transition into a two year\
  \ workstream outlined below.\n\nOur funding request is $38k USDC + $38k GNO (priced\
  \ at the time the proposal passes and locked for one year), paid monthly to Gnosis\
  \ Guild.\n\n**About Gnosis Guild:** *Gnosis Guild is a web3-native venture studio\
  \ with the values of conviviality, co-ownership, and experimentation at its heart.\
  \ For over three years, our team’s modular tooling and needs-driven development\
  \ have secured and operationalized the GnosisDAO’s governance and treasury asset\
  \ management. These include: Zodiac Reality Module for decentralized Snapshot governance;\
  \ Zodiac Roles and bespoke tooling for karpatkey's non-custodial asset management;\
  \ custom strategies for delegation; token locking and distribution systems for CoW\
  \ and Safe; and support and development for other GnosisDAO initiatives like Hashi\
  \ and Gnosis Pay.*\n\n## Service Description\n\nGnosis Guild will guide GnosisDAO’s\
  \ governance through strategic R&D, technical implementation, and ongoing stewardship.\
  \ In response to community feedback and motivated by our commitment to needs-driven\
  \ development for the GnosisDAO, we have outlined objectives that will inform our\
  \ overarching governance strategy and initiatives that address key areas for improvement.\n\
  \n### Objectives:\n\n1. **Improve, maintain, and secure GnosisDAO governance infrastructure.**\n\
  **Indicator:** Increased utility and adoption of GNO as a governance token through\
  \ enhanced voting participation and token utilization.\n\n2. **Foster the growth\
  \ and further decentralization of the Gnosis Ecosystem.**\n**Indicator:** A thriving\
  \ ecosystem with multiple transparent funding mechanisms and active engagement from\
  \ top-tier external contributors.\n\n3. **Position GnosisDAO as leading innovators\
  \ of DAO governance.**\n**Indicator:** Novel governance infrastructure and ongoing\
  \ initiatives to integrate emerging tech.\n\n### Key Performance Indicators:\n\n\
  1. Improvement in annual total vote weight utilized\n2. Improvement in annual total\
  \ voter turnout\n3. Increased allocation of annual total resources per approved\
  \ proposals\n\nWe will use the consistent evaluation of these variables on an ongoing\
  \ basis to measure our impact on our outlined objectives. By measuring vote weight\
  \ utilization, voter turnout, and resource allocation, we can explicitly measure\
  \ governance engagement and implicitly measure proposal quality. While resource\
  \ allocation is inconsistently documented across proposals to date, we estimate\
  \ that an increase in the ratio of total proposed funds to allocated funds would\
  \ correlate with an increase in proposal approvals and quality. We will evaluate\
  \ each proposal individually, but due to the historically significant variation\
  \ in engagement between proposals, our KPIs will be measured on a yearly time period\
  \ to reflect macro trends. For example: from 2022 to 2023, there was a 73% decrease\
  \ in proposals generated, a 66% decrease in total voters, and a 79% decrease in\
  \ total vote weight utilized. While the causes of changes in governance engagement\
  \ are speculative, our intuition is that market dynamics, major events (xDai merger),\
  \ and governance stewardship were contributing factors.\n\n### Initiatives:\n\n\
  A new architecture and roadmap for governance\n\n* Problem: GnosisDAO's monolithic\
  \ governance pattern limits operational efficiency and innovative potential.\n*\
  \ Solution: Develop a new architecture and roadmap to enhance agility and innovation,\
  \ focused on multiple types of roles, organizational units, and parallel governance\
  \ processes.\n\nNovel funding mechanisms to foster the Gnosis Ecosystem\n\n* Problem:\
  \ Opaque ecosystem funding mechanisms hinder capital allocation and ecosystem development.\n\
  * Solution: Implement novel funding mechanisms to scale and grow the Gnosis Ecosystem,\
  \ fostering transparency and capital efficiency. Experiment with, and implement,\
  \ mechanisms like futarchy or conviction voting as parallel allocation methods.\n\
  \nProgressive decentralization of DAO processes\n\n* Problem: Low governance participation\
  \ reflects a perceived lack of value in committing resources.\n* Solution: Facilitate\
  \ progressive decentralization of DAO processes for greater resilience and trustlessness,\
  \ creating a more automated, efficient, and permissionless functioning for the DAO.\n\
  \n### 1. Key aspects\n\n**A new architecture and roadmap for governance**\n\nThe\
  \ current governance process only allows one path for DAO action, namely GIPs. This\
  \ monolithic structure can be very time consuming and involve significant risk on\
  \ both the contributor and DAO sides, along with implying high voter bandwidth.\
  \ Creating multiple types of roles, organizational units, and parallel governance\
  \ processes within the DAO will serve to decentralize decision-making, reduce bottlenecks,\
  \ improve bandwidth, and diversify the DAO’s ability to adapt and respond. Safe\
  \ Guardians, OP Badge Holders, and ENS working groups are a few examples. By effectively\
  \ delegating clearly scoped responsibilities to autonomous groups, GnosisDAO can\
  \ improve its organizational efficiency while reducing the governance overhead of\
  \ its top layer governance. We will develop an evolving architecture, with ongoing\
  \ innovation and experimentation, to remain agile to dynamic needs.\n\n**Novel funding\
  \ mechanisms to foster the Gnosis Ecosystem**\n\nTo scale and grow the Gnosis Ecosystem,\
  \ we will design and implement novel funding mechanisms for maximum capital efficiency.\
  \ Multiple paths to ecosystem funding would enable more autonomous contributions,\
  \ with clear directives and expectations. Optimism and Arbitrum have set an excellent\
  \ example here, and their ecosystem growth is a clear reflection. Frameworks like\
  \ RetroPGF, ARB’s STIP + multiple grants programs, and Safe’s OBRA are all promising\
  \ directions. Similarly, innovation in futarchy and conviction voting has shown\
  \ potential as emerging allocation mechanisms. Based on their successes and pitfalls,\
  \ we will develop our own mechanism suited to the Gnosis Ecosystem.\n\n**Progressive\
  \ decentralization of DAO processes**\n\nBy developing modular, composable DAO governance\
  \ processes, we will increase decentralization and transparency. In reducing any\
  \ single point of failure, the DAO will have greater resilience and trustlessness.\
  \ With the development of new onchain mechanisms, we will create a more automated,\
  \ efficient, and permissionless functioning for the DAO.\n\n### 2. Service Scope\n\
  \nThis proposal is solely for our work stewarding governance of GnosisDAO. Any additional\
  \ work, such as our contributions to Gnosis Pay, Hashi, and DAO treasury management,\
  \ would be out of scope.\n\n### 3. Service delivery\n\n**Immediate Improvements**\n\
  \n* Modernize the GnosisDAO’s Snapshot strategy to correctly account for a greater\
  \ diversity of GNO holders.\n* Enable key delegation features for the DAO: split\
  \ delegation, transitive delegation, and delegation term limits.\n* Implement spam\
  \ proposal filtration\n\n**Research, Architecture, Design**\n\n* Extensive research\
  \ of successful DAO governance architectures\n* Continuous gathering of GNO stakeholder\
  \ feedback\n* Iterative design of novel mechanisms for the DAO’s operations\n* Experimentation\
  \ with parallel, tightly-scoped governance mechanisms\n* Development of a collaborative\
  \ roadmap for the DAO’s evolution\n\n**Technical Implementation**\n\n* Full-stack\
  \ and smart contract development of governance tooling\n* Implement novel governance\
  \ technologies\n\n**Continuous Stewardship and Operations**\n\n* Management of DAO\
  \ governance processes\n* Coordination of calls, feedback, and calendar\n* Active\
  \ engagement in forum to foster transparent, efficient dialogue\n* Rapid response\
  \ to emergent issues and risks\n\n### 4. Support\n\nGnosis Guild will provide community\
  \ technical support and ensure we have a rapid response process to any high-risk\
  \ issues related to GnosisDAO governance.\n\n## Pricing and payment\n\nOur funding\
  \ request is $38k USDC + $38k GNO (priced at the time the proposal passes and locked\
  \ for one year) paid monthly to Gnosis Guild.\n\nThis would ensure we have a stable\
  \ fiat payment to sustain the pod through any downturns, while still providing Gnosis\
  \ Guild with a long-term incentive alignment for our work. The GNO portion would\
  \ also have a 1-year lockup from receipt.\n\nThe duration would be for 24 months,\
  \ able to be terminated at any time.\n\nThe team would be comprised of 3.5 guild\
  \ members including senior full-stack engineers, solidity engineers, mechanism designers,\
  \ governance leads, PM, researchers, comms, and ops as-needed. The typical team\
  \ will include 2 senior engineers, one PM/governance lead, and part-time comms/ops,\
  \ adjusting based on current projects. The total cost to GnosisDAO will remain [competitive\
  \ with other top protocol DAOs](https://tokenterminal.com/resources/crypto-research/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-run-a-dao#4-smart-contract-cyber-security-expenditure).\n\
  \n|Payment Frequency|USDC Allocation|GNO Allocation|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly\
  \ | $38k | $38k |\n\n(using the price of GNO on the date of proposal approval)|\n\
  \n## Service Terms and Exit Strategy\n\nIf applicable the duration of the service\
  \ agreement. Please outline the terms and conditions for exiting the service agreement,\
  \ including the circumstances under which a party may terminate the agreement, and\
  \ any other important details.\n\nThe agreement between service provider Gnosis\
  \ Guild and organization GnosisDAO will take effect immediately upon this proposal\
  \ passing. The terms within the agreement will be valid for two years, unless terminated\
  \ by either party or updated with mutual consent by both parties. GnosisDAO will\
  \ assign specific permissions to Gnosis Guild within their treasury utilizing the\
  \ Roles Modifier to enable Gnosis Guild to autonomously collect payment. Either\
  \ party may terminate the agreement at any time without cause by giving 90 days\
  \ of written notice to the other party. Upon termination, all outstanding payments\
  \ shall be made by GnosisDAO to Gnosis Guild prior to agreement on termination date.\n\
  \n## Team/ Organization\n\n[Gnosis Guild](https://www.gnosisguild.org/) will act\
  \ as an Autonomous Core Contributor for GnosisDAO. Through mutualistic partnerships\
  \ and activist R&D, our team of engineers, designers, and researchers will foster\
  \ the long-term development and sustainable growth of GnosisDAO’s network. See our\
  \ contributor list [here](https://www.notion.so/gnosisguild/ea611cd34400412cabb4121d90aaa94f?v=912defbb43d1452f9c8b66182183376f&pvs=4).\n\
  \n## Initial Trial Period\n\nThe proposal will begin with an Initial Trial Period\
  \ (ITP) that, upon successful completion of its deliverables, will transition into\
  \ the ongoing workstream outlined above. This modification aims to offer more concrete\
  \ test projects, addressing the feedback from Martin and Thomas. The ITP will last\
  \ 3 months and will carry out the following projects:\n\n1. Split and Transitive\
  \ Delegation\n\nIntegration, support, and maintenance of our improved Snapshot delegation\
  \ dashboard and strategy, enabling split delegation, transitive delegation, and\
  \ delegation term limits.\n\n* Split Delegation: Accounts can delegate their vote\
  \ weight to any number of other accounts, along with assigning a specific percentage\
  \ of their voting power to each. For example, Alice could delegate 80% of their\
  \ vote weight to Bob and 20% to Charlie. Voters could also partially delegate to\
  \ new mechanisms, like futarchy or agents, as a test-site for new forms. \n* Transitive\
  \ Delegation: Accounts can delegate not only their own vote weight, but also any\
  \ vote weight delegated to them. For example, if Alice delegates to Bob, and Bob\
  \ delegates to Charlie, Charlie’s total vote weight is the sum of the vote weights\
  \ of Alice, Bob, and Charlie.\n* Delegation Term Limits: Accounts and Snapshot spaces\
  \ can optionally set time limits on how long any given delegation remains valid.\
  \ Spaces can also choose which, if any, term limit to respect when calculating vote\
  \ weights.\n\n2. GnosisDAO Treasury Dashboard\n\nThere is currently no live view\
  \ of the DAO treasury and its wide range of investments. In order to increase transparency\
  \ and better communicate the value behind GNO, we will develop a dashboard that\
  \ aggregates and tracks the DAO treasury and its actively managed positions. This\
  \ will include analytics, charting functionality, open TWAP order tracking, metrics\
  \ on yield, growth, spending, revenue, and private investments that belong to the\
  \ DAO."
