  \n## Executive Summary\n\nGnosis Guild proposes to steward GnosisDAO governance,\
  \ guiding a new phase of innovation, experimentation, and growth. As GnosisDAO continues\
  \ allocating resources to Gnosis Chain, Gnosis Pay, and other mission-aligned ventures,\
  \ our team will drive the DAO’s governance strategy and operations through dedicated\
  \ R&D, technical implementation, and ongoing stewardship.\n\nWhile Gnosis Guild\
  \ has been actively contributing to the maintenance and improvement of GnosisDAO\
  \ governance since its inception, this proposal will formalize a long-term partnership\
  \ that prioritizes the following objectives:\n\n  * Improve, maintain, and secure\
  \ GnosisDAO governance infrastructure.\n  * Foster the growth and further decentralization\
  \ of the Gnosis Ecosystem.\n  * Position GnosisDAO as leading innovators of DAO\
  \ governance.\n\n\n\nThrough these guiding stars, Gnosis Guild will also address\
  \ the challenges currently faced by GnosisDAO’s governance. Initiatives includes:\
  \ (1) designing a new governance architecture and roadmap to tackle the operational\
  \ inefficiency of its monolithic governance patterns, (2) introducing novel funding\
  \ mechanisms to address its inefficient capital allocation and lackluster ecosystem\
  \ development, and (3) progressively decentralizing DAO processes to increase governance\
  \ activity, transparency, and participation.\n\nOur annual funding request is 0.3%\
  \ of AUM, 50% in USDC and 50% in GNO (at the 200-day moving average at the time\
  \ of allocation and locked for one year), paid monthly to Gnosis Guild coinciding\
  \ with karpatkey’s monthly treasury report.\n\n**About Gnosis Guild:** _Gnosis Guild\
  \ is a web3-native venture studio with the values of conviviality, co-ownership,\
  \ and experimentation at its heart. For over three years, our team’s modular tooling\
  \ and needs-driven development have secured and operationalized the GnosisDAO’s\
  \ governance and treasury asset management. These include: Zodiac Reality Module\
  \ for decentralized Snapshot governance; Zodiac Roles and bespoke tooling for karpatkey’s\
  \ non-custodial asset management; custom strategies for delegation; token locking\
  \ and distribution systems for CoW and Safe; and support and development for other\
  \ GnosisDAO initiatives like Hashi and Gnosis Pay._\n\n## Service Description\n\n\
  Gnosis Guild will guide GnosisDAO’s governance through strategic R&D, technical\
  \ implementation, and ongoing stewardship. In response to community feedback and\
  \ motivated by our commitment to needs-driven development for the GnosisDAO, we\
  \ have outlined objectives that will inform our overarching governance strategy\
  \ and initiatives that address key areas for improvement.\n\n### Objectives:\n\n\
  \  1. **Improve, maintain, and secure GnosisDAO governance infrastructure.**  \n\
  **Indicator:** Increased utility and adoption of GNO as a governance token through\
  \ enhanced voting participation and token utilization.\n\n  2. **Foster the growth\
  \ and further decentralization of the Gnosis Ecosystem.**  \n**Indicator:** A thriving\
  \ ecosystem with multiple transparent funding mechanisms and active engagement from\
  \ top-tier external contributors.\n\n  3. **Position GnosisDAO as leading innovators\
  \ of DAO governance.**  \n**Indicator:** Novel governance infrastructure and ongoing\
  \ initiatives to integrate emerging tech.\n\n\n\n\n### Key Performance Indicators:\n\
  \n  1. Improvement in annual total vote weight utilized\n  2. Improvement in annual\
  \ total voter turnout\n  3. Increased allocation of annual total resources per approved\
  \ proposals\n\n\n\nWe will use the consistent evaluation of these variables on an\
  \ ongoing basis to measure our impact on our outlined objectives. By measuring vote\
  \ weight utilization, voter turnout, and resource allocation, we can explicitly\
  \ measure governance engagement and implicitly measure proposal quality. While resource\
  \ allocation is inconsistently documented across proposals to date, we estimate\
  \ that an increase in the ratio of total proposed funds to allocated funds would\
  \ correlate with an increase in proposal approvals and quality. We will evaluate\
  \ each proposal individually, but due to the historically significant variation\
  \ in engagement between proposals, our KPIs will be measured on a yearly time period\
  \ to reflect macro trends. For example: from 2022 to 2023, there was a 73% decrease\
  \ in proposals generated, a 66% decrease in total voters, and a 79% decrease in\
  \ total vote weight utilized. While the causes of changes in governance engagement\
  \ are speculative, our intuition is that market dynamics, major events (xDai merger),\
  \ and governance stewardship were contributing factors.\n\n### Initiatives:\n\n\
  A new architecture and roadmap for governance\n\n  * Problem: GnosisDAO’s monolithic\
  \ governance pattern limits operational efficiency and innovative potential.\n \
  \ * Solution: Develop a new architecture and roadmap to enhance agility and innovation,\
  \ focused on multiple types of roles, organizational units, and parallel governance\
  \ processes.\n\n\n\nNovel funding mechanisms to foster the Gnosis Ecosystem\n\n\
  \  * Problem: Opaque ecosystem funding mechanisms hinder capital allocation and\
  \ ecosystem development.\n  * Solution: Implement novel funding mechanisms to scale\
  \ and grow the Gnosis Ecosystem, fostering transparency and capital efficiency.\n\
  \n\n\nProgressive decentralization of DAO processes\n\n  * Problem: Low governance\
  \ participation reflects a perceived lack of value in committing resources.\n  *\
  \ Solution: Facilitate progressive decentralization of DAO processes for greater\
  \ resilience and trustlessness, creating a more automated, efficient, and permissionless\
  \ functioning for the DAO.\n\n\n\n### 1\\. Key aspects\n\n**A new architecture and\
  \ roadmap for governance**\n\nThe current governance process only allows one path\
  \ for DAO action, namely GIPs. This monolithic structure can be very time consuming\
  \ and involve significant risk on both the contributor and DAO sides, along with\
  \ implying high voter bandwidth. Creating multiple types of roles, organizational\
  \ units, and parallel governance processes within the DAO will serve to decentralize\
  \ decision-making, reduce bottlenecks, improve bandwidth, and diversify the DAO’s\
  \ ability to adapt and respond. Safe Guardians, OP Badge Holders, and ENS working\
  \ groups are a few examples. By effectively delegating clearly scoped responsibilities\
  \ to autonomous groups, GnosisDAO can improve its organizational efficiency while\
  \ reducing the governance overhead of its top layer governance. We will develop\
  \ an evolving architecture, with ongoing innovation and experimentation, to remain\
  \ agile to dynamic needs.\n\n**Novel funding mechanisms to foster the Gnosis Ecosystem**\n\
  \nTo scale and grow the Gnosis Ecosystem, we will design and implement novel funding\
  \ mechanisms for maximum capital efficiency. Multiple paths to ecosystem funding\
  \ would enable more autonomous contributions, with clear directives and expectations.\
  \ Optimism and Arbitrum have set an excellent example here, and their ecosystem\
  \ growth is a clear reflection. Frameworks like RetroPGF, ARB’s STIP + multiple\
  \ grants programs, and Safe’s OBRA are all promising directions. Based on their\
  \ successes and pitfalls, we will develop our own mechanism suited to the Gnosis\
  \ Ecosystem.\n\n**Progressive decentralization of DAO processes**\n\nBy developing\
  \ modular, composable DAO governance processes, we will increase decentralization\
  \ and transparency. In reducing any single point of failure, the DAO will have greater\
  \ resilience and trustlessness. With the development of new onchain mechanisms,\
  \ we will create a more automated, efficient, and permissionless functioning for\
  \ the DAO.\n\n### 2\\. Service Scope\n\nThis proposal is solely for our work stewarding\
  \ governance of GnosisDAO. Any additional work, such as our contributions to Gnosis\
  \ Pay, Hashi, and DAO treasury management, would be out of scope.\n\n### 3\\. Service\
  \ delivery\n\n**Immediate Improvements**\n\n  * Modernize the GnosisDAO’s Snapshot\
  \ strategy to correctly account for a greater diversity of GNO holders.\n  * Enable\
  \ key delegation features for the DAO: split delegation, transitive delegation,\
  \ and delegation term limits.\n  * Implement spam proposal filtration\n\n\n\n**Research,\
  \ Architecture, Design**\n\n  * Extensive research of successful DAO governance\
  \ architectures\n  * Continuous gathering of GNO stakeholder feedback\n  * Iterative\
  \ design of novel mechanisms for the DAO’s operations\n  * Experimentation with\
  \ parallel, tightly-scoped governance mechanisms\n  * Development of a collaborative\
  \ roadmap for the DAO’s evolution\n\n\n\n**Technical Implementation**\n\n  * Full-stack\
  \ and smart contract development of governance tooling\n  * Implement novel governance\
  \ technologies\n\n\n\n**Continuous Stewardship and Operations**\n\n  * Management\
  \ of DAO governance processes\n  * Coordination of calls, feedback, and calendar\n\
  \  * Active engagement in forum to foster transparent, efficient dialogue\n  * Rapid\
  \ response to emergent issues and risks\n\n\n\n### 4\\. Support\n\nGnosis Guild\
  \ will provide community technical support and ensure we have a rapid response process\
  \ to any high-risk issues related to GnosisDAO governance.\n\n## Pricing and payment\n\
  \nGnosis Guild requests an annual compensation of 0.3% AUM, paid pro rata on a monthly\
  \ cadence, coinciding with, and calculated according to, the AUM reported in karpatkey’s\
  \ treasury report for the month. The compensation should be 50% USDC and 50% GNO,\
  \ with the GNO subject to 1 year locking from the time it is distributed.\n\nPayment\
  \ Frequency | USDC Allocation | GNO Allocation  \n---|---|---  \nMonthly | (AUM\
  \ * 0.003 * 0.5) / 12 | (AUM * 0.003 * 0.5) / 12  \n  \n(using the 200-day moving\
  \ average price for GNO at the date of allocation)|\n\nGnosis Guild initially anticipates\
  \ 3-6 individuals working on the identified scope at any given time, with the possibility\
  \ to scale alongside treasury growth. The total cost to GnosisDAO will remain [competitive\
  \ with other top protocol DAOs](https://tokenterminal.com/resources/crypto-research/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-run-a-dao#4-smart-contract-cyber-security-expenditure).\n\
  \n## Service Terms and Exit Strategy\n\nIf applicable the duration of the service\
  \ agreement. Please outline the terms and conditions for exiting the service agreement,\
  \ including the circumstances under which a party may terminate the agreement, and\
  \ any other important details.\n\nThe agreement between service provider Gnosis\
  \ Guild and organization GnosisDAO will take effect immediately upon this proposal\
  \ passing. The terms within the agreement will be valid in perpetuity, unless terminated\
  \ by either party or updated with mutual consent by both parties. GnosisDAO will\
  \ assign specific permissions to Gnosis Guild within their treasury utilizing the\
  \ Roles Modifier to enable Gnosis Guild to autonomously collect payment. Either\
  \ party may terminate the agreement at any time without cause by giving 90 days\
  \ of written notice to the other party. Upon termination, all outstanding payments\
  \ shall be made by GnosisDAO to Gnosis Guild prior to agreement on termination date.\n\
  \n## Team/ Organization\n\n[Gnosis Guild](https://www.gnosisguild.org/) will act\
  \ as an Autonomous Core Contributor for GnosisDAO. Through mutualistic partnerships\
  \ and activist R&D, our team of engineers, designers, and researchers will foster\
  \ the long-term development and sustainable growth of GnosisDAO’s network. See our\
  \ contributor list [here](https://www.notion.so/gnosisguild/ea611cd34400412cabb4121d90aaa94f?v=912defbb43d1452f9c8b66182183376f&pvs=4).\n\
