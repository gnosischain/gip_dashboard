  \ Agreements\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nGnosis Guild proposes to steward GnosisDAO\
  \ governance, guiding a new phase of innovation, experimentation, and growth. As\
  \ GnosisDAO continues allocating resources to Gnosis Chain, Gnosis Pay, and other\
  \ mission-aligned ventures, our team will drive the DAO’s governance strategy and\
  \ operations through dedicated R&D, technical implementation, and ongoing stewardship.\n\
  \nWhile Gnosis Guild has been actively contributing to the maintenance and improvement\
  \ of GnosisDAO governance since its inception, this proposal will formalize a long-term\
  \ partnership that prioritizes the following objectives:\n\n  * Improve, maintain,\
  \ and secure GnosisDAO governance infrastructure.\n  * Foster the growth and further\
  \ decentralization of the Gnosis Ecosystem.\n  * Position GnosisDAO as leading innovators\
  \ of DAO governance.\n\n\n\nThrough these guiding stars, Gnosis Guild will also\
  \ address the challenges currently faced by GnosisDAO’s governance. Initiatives\
  \ includes: (1) designing a new governance architecture and roadmap to tackle the\
  \ operational inefficiency of its monolithic governance patterns, (2) introducing\
  \ novel funding mechanisms to address its inefficient capital allocation and lackluster\
  \ ecosystem development, and (3) progressively decentralizing DAO processes to increase\
  \ governance activity, transparency, and participation.\n\nOur annual funding request\
  \ is 0.3% of AUM, 50% in USDC and 50% in GNO (at the 200-day moving average at the\
  \ time of allocation and locked for one year), paid monthly to Gnosis Guild coinciding\
  \ with karpatkey’s monthly treasury report.\n\n**About Gnosis Guild:** _Gnosis Guild\
  \ is a web3-native venture studio with the values of conviviality, co-ownership,\
  \ and experimentation at its heart. For over three years, our team’s modular tooling\
  \ and needs-driven development have secured and operationalized the GnosisDAO’s\
  \ governance and treasury asset management. These include: Zodiac Reality Module\
  \ for decentralized Snapshot governance; Zodiac Roles and bespoke tooling for karpatkey’s\
  \ non-custodial asset management; custom strategies for delegation; token locking\
  \ and distribution systems for CoW and Safe; and support and development for other\
  \ GnosisDAO initiatives like Hashi and Gnosis Pay._\n\n## Service Description\n\n\
  Gnosis Guild will guide GnosisDAO’s governance through strategic R&D, technical\
  \ implementation, and ongoing stewardship. In response to community feedback and\
  \ motivated by our commitment to needs-driven development for the GnosisDAO, we\
  \ have outlined objectives that will inform our overarching governance strategy\
  \ and initiatives that address key areas for improvement.\n\n### Objectives:\n\n\
  \  1. **Improve, maintain, and secure GnosisDAO governance infrastructure.**  \n\
  **Indicator:** Increased utility and adoption of GNO as a governance token through\
  \ enhanced voting participation and token utilization.\n\n  2. **Foster the growth\
  \ and further decentralization of the Gnosis Ecosystem.**  \n**Indicator:** A thriving\
  \ ecosystem with multiple transparent funding mechanisms and active engagement from\
  \ top-tier external contributors.\n\n  3. **Position GnosisDAO as leading innovators\
  \ of DAO governance.**  \n**Indicator:** Novel governance infrastructure and ongoing\
  \ initiatives to integrate emerging tech.\n\n\n\n\n### Key Performance Indicators:\n\
  \n  1. Improvement in annual total vote weight utilized\n  2. Improvement in annual\
  \ total voter turnout\n  3. Increased allocation of annual total resources per approved\
  \ proposals\n\n\n\nWe will use the consistent evaluation of these variables on an\
  \ ongoing basis to measure our impact on our outlined objectives. By measuring vote\
  \ weight utilization, voter turnout, and resource allocation, we can explicitly\
  \ measure governance engagement and implicitly measure proposal quality. While resource\
  \ allocation is inconsistently documented across proposals to date, we estimate\
  \ that an increase in the ratio of total proposed funds to allocated funds would\
  \ correlate with an increase in proposal approvals and quality. We will evaluate\
  \ each proposal individually, but due to the historically significant variation\
  \ in engagement between proposals, our KPIs will be measured on a yearly time period\
  \ to reflect macro trends. For example: from 2022 to 2023, there was a 73% decrease\
  \ in proposals generated, a 66% decrease in total voters, and a 79% decrease in\
  \ total vote weight utilized. While the causes of changes in governance engagement\
  \ are speculative, our intuition is that market dynamics, major events (xDai merger),\
  \ and governance stewardship were contributing factors.\n\n### Initiatives:\n\n\
  A new architecture and roadmap for governance\n\n  * Problem: GnosisDAO’s monolithic\
  \ governance pattern limits operational efficiency and innovative potential.\n \
  \ * Solution: Develop a new architecture and roadmap to enhance agility and innovation,\
  \ focused on multiple types of roles, organizational units, and parallel governance\
  \ processes.\n\n\n\nNovel funding mechanisms to foster the Gnosis Ecosystem\n\n\
  \  * Problem: Opaque ecosystem funding mechanisms hinder capital allocation and\
  \ ecosystem development.\n  * Solution: Implement novel funding mechanisms to scale\
  \ and grow the Gnosis Ecosystem, fostering transparency and capital efficiency.\n\
  \n\n\nProgressive decentralization of DAO processes\n\n  * Problem: Low governance\
  \ participation reflects a perceived lack of value in committing resources.\n  *\
  \ Solution: Facilitate progressive decentralization of DAO processes for greater\
  \ resilience and trustlessness, creating a more automated, efficient, and permissionless\
  \ functioning for the DAO.\n\n\n\n### 1\\. Key aspects\n\n**A new architecture and\
  \ roadmap for governance**\n\nThe current governance process only allows one path\
  \ for DAO action, namely GIPs. This monolithic structure can be very time consuming\
  \ and involve significant risk on both the contributor and DAO sides, along with\
  \ implying high voter bandwidth. Creating multiple types of roles, organizational\
  \ units, and parallel governance processes within the DAO will serve to decentralize\
  \ decision-making, reduce bottlenecks, improve bandwidth, and diversify the DAO’s\
  \ ability to adapt and respond. Safe Guardians, OP Badge Holders, and ENS working\
  \ groups are a few examples. By effectively delegating clearly scoped responsibilities\
  \ to autonomous groups, GnosisDAO can improve its organizational efficiency while\
  \ reducing the governance overhead of its top layer governance. We will develop\
  \ an evolving architecture, with ongoing innovation and experimentation, to remain\
  \ agile to dynamic needs.\n\n**Novel funding mechanisms to foster the Gnosis Ecosystem**\n\
  \nTo scale and grow the Gnosis Ecosystem, we will design and implement novel funding\
  \ mechanisms for maximum capital efficiency. Multiple paths to ecosystem funding\
  \ would enable more autonomous contributions, with clear directives and expectations.\
  \ Optimism and Arbitrum have set an excellent example here, and their ecosystem\
  \ growth is a clear reflection. Frameworks like RetroPGF, ARB’s STIP + multiple\
  \ grants programs, and Safe’s OBRA are all promising directions. Based on their\
  \ successes and pitfalls, we will develop our own mechanism suited to the Gnosis\
  \ Ecosystem.\n\n**Progressive decentralization of DAO processes**\n\nBy developing\
  \ modular, composable DAO governance processes, we will increase decentralization\
  \ and transparency. In reducing any single point of failure, the DAO will have greater\
  \ resilience and trustlessness. With the development of new onchain mechanisms,\
  \ we will create a more automated, efficient, and permissionless functioning for\
  \ the DAO.\n\n### 2\\. Service Scope\n\nThis proposal is solely for our work stewarding\
  \ governance of GnosisDAO. Any additional work, such as our contributions to Gnosis\
  \ Pay, Hashi, and DAO treasury management, would be out of scope.\n\n### 3\\. Service\
  \ delivery\n\n**Immediate Improvements**\n\n  * Modernize the GnosisDAO’s Snapshot\
  \ strategy to correctly account for a greater diversity of GNO holders.\n  * Enable\
  \ key delegation features for the DAO: split delegation, transitive delegation,\
  \ and delegation term limits.\n  * Implement spam proposal filtration\n\n\n\n**Research,\
  \ Architecture, Design**\n\n  * Extensive research of successful DAO governance\
  \ architectures\n  * Continuous gathering of GNO stakeholder feedback\n  * Iterative\
  \ design of novel mechanisms for the DAO’s operations\n  * Experimentation with\
  \ parallel, tightly-scoped governance mechanisms\n  * Development of a collaborative\
  \ roadmap for the DAO’s evolution\n\n\n\n**Technical Implementation**\n\n  * Full-stack\
  \ and smart contract development of governance tooling\n  * Implement novel governance\
  \ technologies\n\n\n\n**Continuous Stewardship and Operations**\n\n  * Management\
  \ of DAO governance processes\n  * Coordination of calls, feedback, and calendar\n\
  \  * Active engagement in forum to foster transparent, efficient dialogue\n  * Rapid\
  \ response to emergent issues and risks\n\n\n\n### 4\\. Support\n\nGnosis Guild\
  \ will provide community technical support and ensure we have a rapid response process\
  \ to any high-risk issues related to GnosisDAO governance.\n\n## Pricing and payment\n\
  \nGnosis Guild requests an annual compensation of 0.3% AUM, paid pro rata on a monthly\
  \ cadence, coinciding with, and calculated according to, the AUM reported in karpatkey’s\
  \ treasury report for the month. The compensation should be 50% USDC and 50% GNO,\
  \ with the GNO subject to 1 year locking from the time it is distributed.\n\nPayment\
  \ Frequency | USDC Allocation | GNO Allocation  \n---|---|---  \nMonthly | (AUM\
  \ * 0.003 * 0.5) / 12 | (AUM * 0.003 * 0.5) / 12  \n  \n(using the 200-day moving\
  \ average price for GNO at the date of allocation)|\n\nGnosis Guild initially anticipates\
  \ 3-6 individuals working on the identified scope at any given time, with the possibility\
  \ to scale alongside treasury growth. The total cost to GnosisDAO will remain [competitive\
  \ with other top protocol DAOs](https://tokenterminal.com/resources/crypto-research/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-run-a-dao#4-smart-contract-cyber-security-expenditure).\n\
  \n## Service Terms and Exit Strategy\n\nIf applicable the duration of the service\
  \ agreement. Please outline the terms and conditions for exiting the service agreement,\
  \ including the circumstances under which a party may terminate the agreement, and\
  \ any other important details.\n\nThe agreement between service provider Gnosis\
  \ Guild and organization GnosisDAO will take effect immediately upon this proposal\
  \ passing. The terms within the agreement will be valid in perpetuity, unless terminated\
  \ by either party or updated with mutual consent by both parties. GnosisDAO will\
  \ assign specific permissions to Gnosis Guild within their treasury utilizing the\
  \ Roles Modifier to enable Gnosis Guild to autonomously collect payment. Either\
  \ party may terminate the agreement at any time without cause by giving 90 days\
  \ of written notice to the other party. Upon termination, all outstanding payments\
  \ shall be made by GnosisDAO to Gnosis Guild prior to agreement on termination date.\n\
  \n## Team/ Organization\n\n[Gnosis Guild](https://www.gnosisguild.org/) will act\
  \ as an Autonomous Core Contributor for GnosisDAO. Through mutualistic partnerships\
  \ and activist R&D, our team of engineers, designers, and researchers will foster\
  \ the long-term development and sustainable growth of GnosisDAO’s network. See our\
  \ contributor list [here](https://www.notion.so/gnosisguild/ea611cd34400412cabb4121d90aaa94f?v=912defbb43d1452f9c8b66182183376f&pvs=4).\n\

  \n[@armog](/u/armog) thanks for your positive feedback. I can speak to more specifics\
  \ on the payment section.\n\nFirst, we structured this more as a budgetary question\
  \ rather than determining a specific workload. Our approach is: how much of the\
  \ DAO treasury should be allocated to the continuous improvement and expansion of\
  \ its infrastructure? From this perspective, a budget that scales with treasury\
  \ size makes the most sense. A 0.3% annual budget would be on the conservative side\
  \ of spending, given the central importance of the DAO’s governance and ops.\n\n\
  In practice, for the past 9 months the payment would have looked like this:\n\n\

  \ is definitely needed and something we’re hoping to address with this proposal.\n\
  \nGnosis Guild is an independent entity with GnosisDAO as the largest stakeholder\
  \ (20%). Karpatkey, Gnosis Guild, along with Safe and CoW, are all spinouts of GnosisDAO.\
  \ There is certainly overlap, but each of these entities has its own governance\
  \ and decision process. [@ernst](/u/ernst)’s [Gnosis 3.0](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/introducing-gnosis-3-0/)\

  \ Gnosis treasury.\n\n(The voting closure was an error and is now back open)\n\n\

  \ April 10, 2024, 4:00pm  8\n\nAgreed with [@mkoeppelmann](/u/mkoeppelmann) 's suggestion\
  \ to start with 1-2 concrete projects.\n\nTo that end, as a first step I’d suggest\
  \ that the specific problems outlined in this proposal (quoted below) ought to be\
  \ more concretely defined and measured.\n\nFor example, the proposal states that\
  \ one of the initiatives is to “introduc[e] novel funding mechanisms to address\
  \ its **inefficient capital allocation** ”\n\nIf addressing “inefficient capital\
  \ allocation” is the goal, then measuring the current capital efficiency is a logical\
  \ first step in the process, so that a baseline can be established and any improvements\
  \ from that baseline can be measured as well… which somewhat ironically/recursively\
  \ will ensure that the funding of this proposal is also an efficient use of capital.\
  \ Therefore, perhaps the first 1-2 concrete projects that were mentioned could simply\
  \ be **the establishment of baseline metrics** for each of the proposed longer-term\
  \ initiatives.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/user_avatar/forum.gnosis.io/auryn_macmillan/48/97_2.png)\

  \ April 11, 2024, 12:38am  9\n\nThere’s a lot of great replies already so I’ll refrain\
  \ from echoing them. A proposal of this nature coming from the Gnosis Guild, initially\
  \ a DAO tooling project incubated by Gnosis, makes a lot of intuitive sense. The\
  \ team has meaningfully contributed to GnosisDAO governance and [@auryn_macmillan](/u/auryn_macmillan)\
  \ is uniquely positioned to implement what’s being proposed.\n\nGnosis is also uniquely\
  \ positioned to become a leading innovator of DAO governance given its history and\
  \ deep associations with other major DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s no secret\
  \ that DAO governance is difficult. Voter apathy is a behavioral feature of all\
  \ governance frameworks. Coordinating across a distributed team and listening to\
  \ your community is hard.\n\nNow is the time to double down on DAO governance. The\
  \ coordination mechanisms being iterated on now in web3 present a stark contrast\
  \ to the way that proprietary technology is built, often behind closed doors with\
  \ private interest having the final say. It gets even more existential if we digress\
  \ into the AI rabbit hole!\n\nMy point is that our DAO governance is a major feature\
  \ and strength of Gnosis. Our DAO governance could be a lot stronger. We don’t have\
  \ the capacity currently to iterate on novel funding mechanisms or, for example,\
  \ experiment with delegating votes to an AI agent that you’ve trained to perfectly\
  \ represent your personal set of politics. If you believe in a future with co-owned,\
  \ collectively governed technology, then please vote for this proposal.\n\nI can’t\
  \ think of another team that is more equipped and better suited to steward GnosisDAO\
  \ governance than the Gnosis Guild team.\n\n5 Likes\n\n[espina](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/espina)\

  \nWe’re definitely open to completing 1-2 concrete projects to start. That said,\
  \ Gnosis Guild has been contributing to the DAO’s governance for the past several\
  \ years in this format. These one-off projects, while successful in their piecemeal\
  \ implementation, have failed to have the more comprehensive impact we seek here.\
  \ There is also considerable governance overhead for drafting 1-2 short-term proposals,\
  \ which can often take months to materialize.\n\nOur preferred approach in this\
  \ case, would be to absorb that modification into this proposal. We would add an\
  \ initial “trial-period” with 1-2 concrete projects + budget, which upon successful\
  \ completion would transition to the current proposed model. This could also include\

  \ SEEDLatam:\n\n> Having said that, we would like to support this initiative by\
  \ acting as a **working group and core collaborator** to Gnosis Guild’s mission\
  \ in shaping the future of GnosisDAO governance.\n\nI agree that additional support\
  \ in onboarding and community participation would be beneficial — SEED’s expertise\
  \ and experience with similar initiatives could certainly fill that role. Collaborating\
  \ with partners, working groups, and DAO contributors will be critical to the decentralization\
  \ and growth of the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\n3 Likes\n\n  * [Home ](/)\n  * [Categories\
