title: '[Redo]Should the Gnosis DAO create and fund a Gnosis Pay rewards program with
  10k GNO?'
body: '# Summary

  This proposal aims to create a cashback program for Gnosis Pay, benefiting GNO holders.
  The program will feature five tiers of cashback rewards, ranging from 1% to 4% based
  on the amount of GNO deposited in Gnosis Pay. An extra 1% (1pp) will be awarded
  to Gnosis Pay OG NFT holders. Rewards will be airdropped weekly to users ~7 days
  after their transactions, calculated based on the minimum GNO balance held during
  the week the payment was made. The rewards, measured in the currency of the payment,
  will be distributed in GNO using the Gnosis Chain GNO/USD, EUR/USD or GBP/USD Chainlink
  (or Chronicle for GBP) price feed at the time of distribution of the reward. A maximum
  of EUR 20,000, USD 22,000, or GBP 18,000 will be eligible to accrue rewards per
  month for every user.


  # Rationale

  After last year''s outstanding growth, Gnosis Chain has stagnated, mainly due to
  the substantial incentives offered by alternative L1s and L2s. However, many of
  the users and capital in these other chains are likely to leave once the incentives
  end. Gnosis aims to create sticky users through a suite of products, with Gnosis
  Pay being the first. After months of improvements, Gnosis Pay is now ready for mass
  adoption. This cashback program is strategically designed to bootstrap user engagement
  without significant costs to the DAO. Users participating in the program must have
  GNO in their Gnosis Pay Safe wallet, incurring an opportunity cost by not staking
  their GNO. Thus, since GNO held in a Safe wallet will not be staked, the additional
  cost to the DAO would be minimal compared to the benefits.


  # Implementation

  Users who hold GNO in the Gnosis Pay Safe will be eligible for cashback rewards
  on eligible Gnosis Pay Card transactions according to the following tiers:


  ≥0.1 GNO: 1%

  ≥1 GNO: 2%

  ≥10 GNO: 3%

  ≥100 GNO: 4%

  The cashback percentage scales continuously within each tier (e.g., holding 5.5
  GNO earns 2.5% cashback). Beyond 100 GNO, the cashback percentage does not increase
  any further. Additionally, Gnosis Pay OG NFT holders who qualify for the airdrop
  (with at least 0.1 GNO deposited) will receive an extra 1% cashback. For instance,
  a user holding 5.5 GNO and the OG NFT would receive 3.5% cashback. This feature
  will add value to future NFT campaigns by Gnosis Pay (e.g., referral programs).


  A maximum of EUR 20,000, USD 22,000, or GBP 18,000 will be eligible to accrue rewards
  per month for every user.


  The program will be administered and managed by Karpatkey, responsible for tracking,
  determining, and distributing the rewards, as well as reporting the results. The
  reward calculation code will be open source. We will also provide an endpoint for
  those that want to feature the rewards in their UIs.


  Rewards will be distributed weekly, 5-12 days after the user made the payment, based
  on the lowest amount of GNO tokens held in their Gnosis Pay Safe during the week
  the payment was made. It is this amount of GNO held prior to the card payment that
  will be relevant in calculating the cashback. For example, having 1 GNO in the Gnosis
  Pay Safe and making a payment in the same week would yield 2% cashback. However,
  topping up GNO to the Gnosis Pay Safe after a payment does not change the cashback
  applicable to that payment. Eligible “payments” do not include ATM withdrawals,
  which will not count towards card payments for the purposes of this program. By
  participating in the program (transferring GNO to the Gnosis Pay Safe), users agree
  that Gnosis Pay will share transaction details related to ATM withdrawals with karpatkey.
  Transactions similar to this one on essence (for example, topping up bank accounts
  with the card) will also not be eligible, and this information will also be shared.
  However, personal information will not be shared. The program will run until the
  budget runs off, or until the DAO votes to terminate it or replace it. Cashback
  received from payments there were refunded will tracked and until the users has
  a "positive balance" of accrued rewards, no further payments will be made.


  Shall this proposal passes, a trial period will commence on August 19th, which will
  run for a week and will not accrue any rewards. Then, the actual program will commence
  on August 26th.


  The GNO Cashback Program is sponsored by GnosisDAO, offered and administered by
  the Gnosis DAO Operational Foundation, and operated by karpatkey in accordance with
  its mandate from the Sponsor.'
