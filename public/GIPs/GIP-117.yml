title: Strategic Partnership with Backed through Liquidity Incentives on Gnosis Chain
body: "## Executive Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests offering $1M worth of GNO tokens\
  \ as liquidity incentives for Backed’s bTokens on Gnosis Chain, creating a unique\
  \ value proposition for the ecosystem. Gnosis is currently the leading ecosystem\
  \ after mainnet for tokenized equities according to RWA.xyz, and we want to strengthen\
  \ these markets.\n\nWe propose to support the rollout of equity assets on Gnosis\
  \ Chain through Backed, supported by GNO token incentives. This initiative aims\
  \ to differentiate Gnosis Chain in the DeFi landscape and provide users with an\
  \ opportunity to diversify from crypto to equities while earning additional yields.\n\
  \nBacked brings real-world assets on-chain. Backed issues permissionless tokens\
  \ that track the value of real-world assets and are fully collateralized by them,\
  \ such as stocks or ETFs. Tokens are issued under an approved EU prospectus. Gnosis\
  \ VC has led both of Backed’s investment rounds.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Liquidity\
  \ Incentives\n\n  * GnosisDAO will allocate $1M worth of GNO tokens for liquidity\
  \ incentives.\n  * These incentives will be distributed over a 6-month period.\n\
  \n\n\n### Asset Selection and Incentive Distribution\n\n  * 5 equity assets will\
  \ be selected for this initiative via a staged rollout.\n\n    * Initially, the\
  \ bCSPX pool will be targeted for the launch of this initiative.\n    * Then pools\
  \ of bNVDA and bCOIN will be deployed and incentives applied.\n    * Then pools\
  \ of bMSTR and bTSLA will be deployed and incentives applied.\n  * Each asset will\
  \ have its own pool, paired against sDAI deposits.\n\n  * $200k worth of GNO will\
  \ be allocated to each pool.\n\n  * Incentives will be distributed proportionally\
  \ over 6 months.\n\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal offers several benefits:\n\
  \n  1. Unique Value Proposition: By offering equity assets, Gnosis Chain differentiates\
  \ itself from other blockchain platforms. Gnosis already leads in this market currently,\
  \ and with targeted incentives, Gnosis can become the home of tokenized equity trading.\n\
  \  2. User Incentives: The additional 10% yield incentivizes users to choose Gnosis\
  \ Chain for diversifying into equities.\n  3. Simplified Investment: Users can easily\
  \ diversify from crypto to equities within the Gnosis ecosystem.\n  4. Strategic\
  \ Partnership: The $1M GNO will strengthen our continued partnership with Backed.\n\
