title: Strategic Partnership with Backed through Liquidity Incentives on Gnosis Chain
body: "# **GIP-117: Strategic Partnership with Backed through Liquidity Incentives\
  \ on Gnosis Chain**\n\n## **Executive Summary**\n\nThis proposal suggests offering\
  \ $1M worth of GNO tokens as liquidity incentives for Backed’s bTokens on Gnosis\
  \ Chain, creating a unique value proposition for the ecosystem. Gnosis is currently\
  \ the leading ecosystem after mainnet for tokenized equities according to [RWA.xyz](https://app.rwa.xyz/stocks),\
  \ and we want to strengthen these markets.\n\nWe propose to support the rollout\
  \ of equity assets on Gnosis Chain through Backed, supported by GNO token incentives.\
  \ This initiative aims to differentiate Gnosis Chain in the DeFi landscape and provide\
  \ users with an opportunity to diversify from crypto to equities while earning additional\
  \ yields. \n\nBacked brings real-world assets on-chain. Backed issues permissionless\
  \ tokens that track the value of real-world assets and are fully collateralized\
  \ by them, such as stocks or ETFs. Tokens are issued under an approved EU prospectus.\
  \ Gnosis VC has led both of Backed’s investment rounds.\n\n## **Specification**\n\
  \n### **Liquidity Incentives**\n\n* GnosisDAO will allocate $1M worth of GNO tokens\
  \ for liquidity incentives.  \n* These incentives will be distributed over a 6-month\
  \ period.\n\n### **Asset Selection and Incentive Distribution**\n\n* 4 equity assets\
  \ will be selected for this initiative via a staged rollout.   \n  * Initially,\
  \ the bCSPX pool will be targeted for the launch of this initiative.  \n  * Then\
  \ pools of bNVDA, bCOIN and bTSLA will be deployed and incentives applied.  \n*\
  \ Each asset will have its own pool, paired against sDAI deposits.  \n* $250k worth\
  \ of GNO will be allocated to each pool.  \n* Incentives will be distributed proportionally\
  \ over 6 months.\n\n## **Rationale**\n\nThis proposal offers several benefits:\n\
  \n1. **Unique Value Proposition**: By offering equity assets, Gnosis Chain differentiates\
  \ itself from other blockchain platforms. Gnosis already leads in this market currently,\
  \ and with targeted incentives, Gnosis can become the home of tokenized equity trading.\
  \  \n2. **User Incentives**: The additional 10% yield incentivizes users to choose\
  \ Gnosis Chain for diversifying into equities.  \n3. **Simplified Investment**:\
  \ Users can easily diversify from crypto to equities within the Gnosis ecosystem.\
  \  \n4. **Strategic Partnership**: The $1M GNO will strengthen our continued partnership\
  \ with Backed."
