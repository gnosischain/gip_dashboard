  fund?

  author: Ben, GnosisVC

  type: Funding

  status: Draft

  created: 2024-06-10

  duration: 7y

  funding: $20 million


  Summary


  GnosisDAO should finance the new GnosisVC fund to promote further ecosystem growth
  and product lines in the selected target verticals.

  Abstract


  GnosisVC fund will raise a total of $40m, wherein GnosisDAO will invest $20m and
  the remaining $20m will be raised from external LPs.

  GnosisVC will invest in early-stage projects to accelerate the development, adoption,
  and growth of DApps and fintech integrations strengthening the broader Gnosis Ecosystem.


  GnosisVC fund will deploy into early-stage projects in line with the existing Gnosis
  3.0 thesis with a focus on RWAs, Decentralized Infrastructure, and Financial Payment
  Rails as target verticals.

  Fund Structure & Terms


  The fund will be set up as a Cayman-exempt limited partnership with a term of 7
  years (+ up to 2 years extension) and a 2/20 fee structure (2% management fees and
  20% carry per industry standards).


  The investment period will last for 3 years, with the expected schedule of the capital
  calls being ca. one-third of the total commitment to be paid in per year.


  Deliverables to LPs will include:

  Quarterly reports on the investment portfolio posted on DAO forum.

  Investment summaries are shared with LPs via a dedicated data room.

  Implementation Initiatives


  Venture Fund:

  Support and incubate projects through funding, governance participation, and advisory.


  Gnosis Ecosystem Integration:

  Onboarding and integrating portfolio companies into the larger Gnosis ecosystem
  through an introduction to existing Gnosis projects and by facilitating a collaborative
  environment.


  Maintenance:

  Continued review and collaboration with existing partners and ongoing assistance
  for portfolio companies from GIP 38.


  Reporting:

  Quarterly reports and updates on investments and portfolio companies will be shared
  with the DAO, as well as their contribution to the evolution of the Gnosis 3.0 thesis.

  Investment Thesis


  GnosisVC will be deploying capital into projects that will strengthen the existing
  Gnosis ecosystem through but not limited to the following three investment verticals:

  Financial Payments


  Incremental margins are the core of the payment stack. The vertical is very crowded
  with a deeply intermediated stack and heavy cross selling. Focussing on payments
  middleware around Gnosis Pay, the fund should have considerable experience and informational
  advantages to be able to build out an integrated stack from the point of sale onwards.

  Decentralized Infrastructure


  The future of computing and data availability is open source. In the absence of
  a fully mature Zero-Knowledge cryptography stack, the decentralization of services
  and applications at scale must proceed hand-in-hand with an equivalent decentralization
  of the underlying component infrastructure. The development of such an internet-native
  substrate must be tackled from multiple avenues: data availability, composable compute
  environments, orchestration and coordination of tasks, tooling, and real-time analytics
  to name a few. As a case study, LLMs have captured the public imagination on a circa
  6-year-old technology. While there has been a lot of focus on model quality, model
  tooling, hosting, and standalone end-user deployments are an equally important but
  frequently underestimated part of the vertical. Historically, some of the most impressive
  investments by Gnosis have been infrastructure-related (MatterLabs, Gelato, TheGraph).
  As such, we believe that this vertical stays true to the Gnosis DNA.

  RWA


  The Defi crypto markets are saturated with liquidity and narrative-driven demand
  without sufficient credit products to deploy into. This is due to the current need
  for full collateralization, so capital is abundant while investment opportunities
  are still scarce, there is also huge latent demand for institutional adoption through
  stablecoins, yield-bearing instruments, and new liquid RWAs. The continued growth
  of self-custodial alternatives to existing CeFi interfaces presents the opportunity
  to funnel conventional financial players into the already existing Defi stack.
