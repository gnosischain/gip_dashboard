title: Reimburse expenditures to the Gnosis Chain Core Development Unit (formerly
  xDai Chain team)
body: 'Summary

  GIP-32 requests reimbursement of infrastructure and marketing-related expenditures
  to the Gnosis Chain Core Development Unit (formerly xDai Chain team) for the period
  spanning the token merge (GIP-16 implementation) through March 1st, 2022.


  Motivation

  The Gnosis Chain Core Development Unit is a critical component of the evolving Gnosis
  ecosystem. Previous expenditures were provided up-front by the team to facilitate
  client development and bootstrap the consensus-layer validator set. These were distributed
  from an independent fund managed by the Core Dev Unit to expedite processes with
  the expectation that they would be reimbursed at a future date. This GIP details
  prior expenditures and requests they are reimbursed from the GnosisDAO treasury.

  the mandate. The details of this multi-sig wallet are as follows:
