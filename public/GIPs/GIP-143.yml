title: Should the GnosisDAO Terminate karpatkey Treasury Management Services?
body: 'Executive Summary

  This proposal seeks to terminate karpatkey’s treasury management services for GnosisDAO,
  effective immediately from the passing of this proposal, with a 14 day transition
  period. No further payments are to be made to, nor retained by, karpatkey.


  Motivation

  Following extensive community discussions over the past weeks regarding treasury
  management performance, cost, risk exposure, and alignment with DAO objectives,
  this proposal formalises the decision to conclude karpatkey’s engagement as GnosisDAO’s
  treasury manager.


  Specification

  Action: Terminate the treasury management agreement with karpatkey effective immediately

  Timeline: 14-day transition period from proposal passing

  Transition: karpatkey to provide complete handover; documentation of all positions,
  strategies, and access controls within 14 days

  Assets: All GnosisDAO assets under karpatkey management to be returned to direct
  DAO control and withdrawn from any karpatkey affiliated product (i.e. kpk Morpho
  vaults, kpk vaults). Where there is difficulty in handing over positions due to
  edge cases in allocation, ETH denominated positions may be converted to wstETH and
  USD denominated positions may be converted to sUSDS/sxDAI in order to hand them
  over.

  Upon receipt of the assets, GnosisDAO representatives will begin the process of
  converting all treasury assets to sUSDS, wstETH, and Gnosis Ecosystem tokens before
  engaging in next steps regarding the treasury strategy.

  Implementation

  Revoke all Safe signer permissions held by karpatkey team

  Transfer all assets to GnosisDAO-controlled addresses

  Document all active DeFi positions for orderly unwinding

  Cease all new treasury operations immediately upon proposal passing


  Milestones

  N/A


  Note: Given the clear community interest expressed in recent forum discussions,
  this proposal moves directly to Phase 2 temperature check.


  EDIT [ON TIMELINES]:

  Mainnet funds are handed over in full, and the Gnosis Chain portion of the treasury
  enters an ongoing ‘handover state’ that requires all non-liquidity funds (including
  out of range liquidity) to be handed over, and the remainder to be managed by karpatkey
  purely for liquidity provision purposes until a new liquidity management agreement
  is put in place with an alternative provider.


  In the event that karpatkey would prefer to disengage immediately following a successful
  vote rather than engage in this handover state, then all active liquidity on Gnosis
  Chain should be moved to full range Uni v3 positions while selecting a new liquidity
  manager via an RFP process.'
