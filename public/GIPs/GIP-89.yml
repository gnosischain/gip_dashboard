title: Should GnosisDAO support an annual renewal for Blockscout SLA and hosting services?
body: 'Blockscout continues to serve the Gnosis ecosystem with an open-source explorer
  for both the Gnosis mainnet and Chiado testnet instances. Blockscout hosting was
  originally funded in GIP 54 for mainnet and GIP 71 for the Chiado testnet.


  Over the past year, Blockscout has attracted and retained Gnosis users and developers,
  providing a valuable explorer option and needed redundancy for chain exploration.
  While Gnosis mainnet users can choose Gnosisscan or Blockscout for their exploration,
  contract verification, and API needs, Blockscout is currently the only full-featured
  explorer serving the Chiado execution layer.


  While Blockscout usage is down somewhat from its peak when it was the only explorer
  option for the chain, many users still prefer Blockscout. A few high level statistics
  from GA & Mixpanel:


  ~45K monthly views, 9.5K MAU for Gnosis Mainnet Blockscout instance.

  ~100 contracts verified in the previous month using Blockscout.

  ~1,000 signups to myAccount since the feature was introduced.

  ~550 Marketplace views over the previous month.

  ~7K monthly views for Chiado.

  Additional chain stats (not instance specific) are available at Gnosis chain statistics
  | Blockscout.


  Over the past year Blockscout has focused on optimizations and improvements which
  have been upstreamed to the Gnosis instances on a priority basis. These include
  a complete UI overhaul, multiple indexer upgrades, advanced statistics and the new
  MyAccount and Dapp Marketplace features.


  Updates scheduled for the upcoming year include:


  Advanced filtering and sorting options

  Human readable transactions

  NFT views and explorer improvements

  Smart search with AI

  More Rust-based microservices

  Support for ENS and ENS forks


  Project Deliverables


  Continue to maintain Blockscout instances for Gnosis Chain and Chiado testnet on
  Blockscout’s premises

  with an option to extend)

  team

  Support for end-users of the explorer managed via Discord


  Execution Timeline


  Start time


  Proposed start time for the renewal is October 1, 2023.


  Previous services for the hosted mainnet instance began on July 17, 2022 and officially
  expired on July 18, 2023 (per GIP 54) . Since that time we have hosted the mainnet
  instance at our own cost. We propose crediting 2 weeks (July 18-July 31) and receiving
  back payments for 2 months (August and September) of hosting services in addition
  to the new annual engagement cost.

  Previous payment for the Chiado testnet was received on November 29, 2022 and scheduled
  to extend through Nov 29, 2023. We propose reducing the time for this support by
  2 months, so that the new engagement can begin and end at the same time as mainnet.

  New proposed timeline: Gnosis Mainnet and Chiado testnet will be supported from
  October 1, 2023 - October 1, 2024.

  If the proposal is still in consideration on Oct 1 but no final decision has been
  made, hosting and support will continue without interruption until the governance
  process is completed, and the timeline will be amended accordingly.


  Funding & Disbursement


  Hosting costs cover high-capacity bandwidth, infrastructure upgrades, data storage
  (2000GiB and growing), and devops for the networks. Feature enhancements and priority
  support are also included as part of the package.


  Over the past year we have analyzed instance usage and optimized our backend infrastructure
  and processes, and are happy to offer a discount on pricing for the instances ($500
  less per month relative to 2022 pricing). Chiado testnet pricing is scoped as a
  2nd instance, resulting in a lower cost.


  Gnosis Chain Mainnet: $112,000.00


  $8,000 per month for 14 months (August and September 2023 + 1 year of service 1
  October, 2023 - 1 October, 2024)

  Chiado Testnet: $40,000


  $4,000 per month for 10 months (credit of October and November 2023 + 1 year of
  service 1 October, 2023 - 1 October, 2024)

  Total cost: $152,000.00 due 1 October, 2023


  Amount is requested up front for the year. Payment can be made to Blockscout’s SAFE
  0xAddress on Ethereum mainnet (0x242ba6d68FfEb4a098B591B32d370F973FF882B7) with
  USDC or USDT.'
