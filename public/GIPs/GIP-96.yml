title: Should the GnosisDAO allow the legal conduit being set up to onboard Centrifuge
  Prime, to also hold other investments, including those made by the Gnosis Builders
  prior to their dissolution?
body: 'With the Dissolution of the Gnosis Builders, the bulk of the funds as approved
  under GIP-38, and not yet spent, have been returned to the DAO. Some investments
  are, however, currently illiquid as they were invested by the Gnosis Builders in
  early stage projects. Such investments inherently carry a lesser degree of liquidity,
  and may contain conditions relating to vesting, lock-ups, future delivery obligations
  (e.g. upon the occurrence of a token generation or other trigger event) etc…


  This proposal intends to seek a vote from the GnosisDAO to enable the legal conduit,
  Gnosis Asset Holdings I Foundation (the “Foundation”), which is being set up to
  onboard Centrifuge Prime as described in the update to GIP-91 posted here as GIP-94
  3, to also hold other illiquid investments, including those made historically by
  the Gnosis Builders.'
