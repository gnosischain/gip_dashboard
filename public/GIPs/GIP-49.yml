title: Should GnosisDAO do a BFF Partnership with MakerDAO?
body: 'GnosisDAO and MakerDAO are naturally aligned with DAI as a common denominator.
  Gnosis Chain uses bridged DAI as its gas token so DAI’s adoption is critical for
  the success of the network.


  Gnosis Ltd has already started buying MKR aggressively in the open market so it
  makes sense to align efforts with the GnosisDAO. Therefore, we propose the following:


  1. Propose a token swap GNO-MKR of around $70 million to the Maker community

  2. Explore the use of an institutional MakerDAO vault with the GnosisDAO treasury
  using GNO + stETH and mint 100 million DAI to be used for the development of the
  Gnosis Chain

  3. Explore a GNO grant with MakerDAO growth core unit to expand global adoption
  and brand awareness of Gnosis Chain

  4. Rebranding xDAI to DAI

  5. Increase GNO incentives to DAI pairs on Gnosis Chain

  6. Periodically buy MKR in the open market using GnosisDAO’s treasury farming rewards'
