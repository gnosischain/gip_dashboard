title: Should Gnosis Partner with DAOhaus to Support DAO tooling on Gnosis Chain?
body: "https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-69-should-gnosis-partner-with-daohaus-to-support-dao-tooling-on-gnosis-chain/5970\n\
  \nSummary\nDAOhaus wants to deepen its partnership with GnosisDAO and is requesting\
  \ $300k USD equivalent in stablecoins or GNO to the DAOhaus Core Contributor DAO,\
  \ WarCamp.\n\nAbstract/Description\nDAOhaus provides purpose driven communities\
  \ on Gnosis Chain with an open and free to use no-code platform for launching and\
  \ managing their Moloch DAOs.\n\nBased on our activity on Gnosis Chain and previous\
  \ collaborations with Gnosis, DAOhaus is interested in deepening the partnership\
  \ between GnosisDAO and DAOhaus by supporting initiatives to drive more activity\
  \ and communities to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\nOur goals around making DAO\
  \ tooling more accessible and composable for both users and developers aligns with\
  \ Gnosis’ goals to attract more users and developers to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\
  \nWe believe Gnosis Chain enhances the cultural relevance of the Ethereum ecosystem\
  \ and is comparable in cultural legitimacy to Mainnet. DAOhaus is thrilled to support\
  \ and be supported by Gnosis Chain.\n\nMotivation/Rationale\nWe have been referring\
  \ to Gnosis Chain as the “DAO Chain” for the better part of a year, and it is safe\
  \ to say that DAOhaus calls Gnosis Chain home.\n\nWe are proud contributors to the\
  \ Gnosis Chain Weekly newsletter, producing a DAO of the Week 1 piece each week\
  \ and the Zodiac DAO wiki as early and ongoing contributors of DAO success patterns.\n\
  \nAll of our core operations take place on Gnosis Chain and DAOhaus has provided\
  \ DAOs on Gnosis Chain with excellent tooling, bug maintenance, support and a seamless\
  \ UX - thanks to Gnosis’ high tx throughput & low costs.\n\nDAOhaus provides pertinent\
  \ subgraph infrastructure to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem, where the daohaus-xdai\
  \ subgraphs [1] [2] [3] have around ~700k queries per day with no server or IP querying\
  \ more than ~40k on a given day, resulting in a fairly wide distribution of DAOhaus\
  \ subgraph queries!\n\nSince 2020, DAOhaus users have created 1k+ DAOs on Gnosis\
  \ Chain, onboarded 10k+ unique DAO members, submitted 40k+ proposals, and launched\
  \ 700+ Gnosis Safes through the DAOhaus app. [1] [2] [3]\n\nAs of 2021, DAOhaus\
  \ DAOs have had approximately $400M in total value flow through the platform.\n\n\
  A stablecoin or GNO grant from Gnosis DAO would increase our capacity to build more\
  \ valuable tools for DAOs and ultimately bring more DAOs, users, devs, and talent\
  \ into the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\nIf passed, DAOhaus and Gnosis will enter into\
  \ a positive and mutually reinforcing collaboration that will sustain growth across\
  \ the Gnosis Chain ecosystem for years to come.\n\nSpecification\nGrant funds will\
  \ be allocated to three primary areas of focus, each of which supports our larger\
  \ objective to bring community-first coordination tools to more human networks.\n\
  \nDeliverables and Activities\n1. New DAO deployment tools\nDevelopment of a Safe\
  \ Summoner App - enabling multisigs to easily level up into DAOhaus v3 DAOs\nDevelopment\
  \ of apps/tools for migrating from DAOhaus v2 to DAOhaus v3\n2. Educational content\
  \ for DAO users & operators\nCreate docs, explainers, and tutorials for new and\
  \ experienced DAO users & operators\nFocus on common governance patterns, best practices,\
  \ migration paths and more.\n3. Developer advocacy, outreach, and support\nTo be\
  \ executed by the DAOhaus developer relations (DevRel) working group\n\nEncourage\
  \ use of the DAOhaus v3 libraries by external development teams\nProvide active\
  \ integration support & guidance to Gnosis ecosystem developers\nInform and execute\
  \ further development of DAOhaus v3 libraries based on developer community needs\n\
  Fund developer grants, bounties, and/or hackathon prizes\nOverview\nEach of the\
  \ above initiatives will support our goal of onboarding 100 new DAOs to Gnosis Chain\
  \ by Q2 2023. Additionally, these activities will have the following positive impact\
  \ for Gnosis:\n\nProvide Gnosis Safe users additional community-oriented options\
  \ for governing their assets and network\nProvide additional paths for developers\
  \ to build on Gnosis Chain and Zodiac\nIncrease support for developers on Gnosis\
  \ Chain\nTeam\nThis work will be conducted by Warcamp, the DAO of core contributors\
  \ to DAOhaus.\n\nThis table represents the current team assembled for executing\
  \ on the deliverables outlined above. Personnel changes are quick on our team and\
  \ can be expected in the coming months. We offer this as a soft guideline for how\
  \ we are thinking about work distribution.\n\nContributor\tPrimary Role\n01000011\
