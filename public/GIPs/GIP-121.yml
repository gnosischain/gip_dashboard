title: ​Should GnosisDAO accept a combined total of 7.5% ownership for incubating
  karpatkey DAO?
body: 'Simple Summary

  This proposal signals GnosisDAOs acceptance of a 5% allocation of karpatkey DAO’s
  airdrop, bringing GnosisDAO’s total stake in KPK to 7.5% of the fully diluted supply.


  Abstract

  karpatkey has led the active DAO treasury management space after becoming GnosisDAO’s
  treasury manager in GIP-20 2 and GIP-58 1, and GIP-95 1. Specifically, GIP-20 laid
  the foundation for karpatkey DAO as a project incubated by GnosisDAO. Following
  in the footsteps and tradition of the sister projects such as CowDAO and SafeDAO,
  karpatkey will launch a DAO and a governance token (KPK).


  This proposal allocates 5% of its airdrop to GnosisDAO, bringing GnosisDAO’s total
  stake in KPK to 7.5% (GIP-20) 2 of the fully diluted supply.


  This is a revision of GIP-92. https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-92-should-gnosis-dao-spin-off-karpatkey-dao-and-deploy-the-kpk-token/8115


  Introduction

  karpatkey is the leading DAO service provider for active, non-custodial treasury
  management.


  The project was founded in 2021, beginning with initial engagements to manage treasury
  funds for Gnosis Ltd and GnosisDAO. As a result, Gnosis and karpatkey have always
  been deeply connected.


  Gnosis has supported karpatkey’s efforts to build and test sophisticated DAO treasury
  management products and processes. In turn, karpatkey has provided many essential
  contributions to GnosisDAO, Gnosis Chain and other Gnosis-incubated products (see
  karpatkey’s 2022, 2023, and 2024 reports for more details). Together, these mutual
  contributions have focused on creating long-term value for stakeholders in Gnosis,
  karpatkey and the broader ecosystem, including GNO and future KPK holders.


  With Gnosis’ support, karpatkey has expanded to serve a dozen DAO treasuries. Within
  its network, the team has established and served on a selection of finance working
  groups, including GnosisDAO, ENS, Balancer, dYdX, CoW, Lido and Aave. They have
  also contributed to specific initiatives for Uniswap, Safe, Arbitrum and Sky (formerly
  MakerDAO). Many of these relationships have generated significant value for Gnosis
  by supporting incubated projects, delivering new integrations and joint initiatives,
  and even providing strategic investment opportunities. The fact that karpatkey has
  continued to grow and thrive in the recent bear market is a testament to the product
  market-fit that their solutions have found.


  At heart, karpatkey is focused on risk management and resilience, helping leading
  DAOs to thrive by ensuring that they can survive in perpetuity. The team is characterised
  by its prudent, rigorous and long-term-oriented approach. This mentality has been
  key in enabling karpatkey to preside over more than 10,000 DAO transactions across
  more than $2 billion in assets with zero funds lost. The same mentality helps them
  develop and maintain tooling and frameworks that can help the entire industry become
  more resilient.


  Like COW DAO and Safe DAO before them, karpatkey has gradually extended its activities
  from the Gnosis ecosystem outwards and cultivated its own healthy business model
  and community. With GnosisDAO’s blessing, the time has come for karpatkey to formally
  launch its own public DAO.


  About the KPK Token

  The goal of the KPK 4 token is to align the parties actively contributing to the
  delivery of karpatkey’s success. Tokenholders can vote on key decisions, such as
  treasury management, budget allocations, and strategic initiatives like buybacks
  or M&A activities, to align with karpatkey’s long-term sustainability. The token’s
  utility is focused on facilitating community-driven decision-making and fostering
  an active, engaged ecosystem.


  KPK will be deployed initially on Ethereum Mainnet, with a fixed supply of 1 billion
  tokens. It will be non-transferrable at launch, with karpatkey DAO reserving its
  right to decide if and when to activate transferability.


  How does GnosisDAO benefit from this proposal?

  As described in the introduction, GnosisDAO has been an essential and fundamental
  partner to karpatkey since beginning its services to GnosisDAO in 2021. In appreciation
  of its support, this proposal seeks to allocate a further 5% of the KPK token supply
  to GnosisDAO immediately upon launch, combined with the 2.5% specified in GIP-20,
  increasing GnosisDAO’s share of ownership up to 7.5%.


  By positioning GnosisDAO as a key tokenholder in karpatkey DAO, this proposal seeks
  to maintain strong and strategic alignment between the two DAOs, ensuring an ongoing
  place for GnosisDAO at the centre of karpatkey’s network and at the forefront of
  its technological innovation and progress.


  Specification

  This proposal directs karpatkey to deploy the KPK token and allocate 5% of its airdrop
  to GnosisDAO, bringing GnosisDAO’s total stake in KPK to 7.5% of the fully diluted
  supply.


  Upon approval:


  KPK will be deployed by the karpatkey team, formalizing vesting for the 2.5% KPK
  allocation from GIP-20 (2-year vesting, already vested) and establishing a 2-year
  vesting plan for the 5% allocation to GnosisDAO. The vesting terms for the airdrop
  align with karpatkey’s 2024 investment round 2 and will begin on TTE or 1 year after
  this proposal passes, whichever comes first.

  This proposal does not disqualify GnosisDAO from future additional airdrops.

  All remaining KPK beside the GnosisDAO allocation will be sent to the karpatkey
  treasury.


  Governance processes for karpatkey DAO will be introduced gradually in the coming
  weeks.


  The launch of the KPK token and karpatkey DAO will not affect karpatkey’s ongoing
  service arrangements under GIP-20, GIP-58, and GIP-95.

  If this proposal is not approved by GnosisDAO, karpatkey will proceed with launching
  its token and DAO independently while continuing its plans. GnosisDAO will remain
  a close partner and receive the 2.5% allocation from GIP-20 alongside other investors.
  Any future allocations or investments involving GnosisDAO will remain open for discussion
  and subject to mutual agreement between both DAOs.
