title: Pilot a Gnosis Growth Fund for small scale, community-led ecosystem funding
body: '## Proposal Overview

  This proposal requests $40k in funding to be added directly to a GNO community-owned
  conviction voting pool on Gardens. The purpose of this pool is to help resource
  growth initiatives that foster a healthier, more diverse Gnosis Ecosystem. This
  is the 2nd attempt of a vote for the same proposal that fell short of quorum last
  week: https://snapshot.box/#/s:gnosis.eth/proposal/0xff2ea0fb10996165e0d31f25522d24e345146682058f894a42b3ba158905360a


  This experiment allows the Gnosis community to try out a mechanism aimed at giving
  GNO holders more agency in the DAO, and plants the seeds for a more resilient ecosystem
  by expanding the diversity of projects and initiatives being resourced.


  This community would be guided by Gnosis’s mission of Building the Open Internet,
  enforced through an onchain Covenant.


  The Gardens Core team is offering to set up this pilot free of charge with 100%
  of funds added to the Growth Fund directed by GNO holders.


  ## Proposal Details

  As a starting point, we suggest Gnosis DAO replicate an active pilot recently launched
  in the Safe Ecosystem:

  In short, this setup includes:

  * A Gnosis Community on Gardens - an open community members can join by signing
  an onchain Covenant and staking GNO.

  * Governance Pool #1 - Council Safe Election - a signaling pool in the Gnosis Garden
  to elect the signers of the admin Safe for the community

  * Governance Pool #2 - Priority Signaling - a signaling pool in the Gnosis Garden
  where the community can curate the ecosystem’s pain points and prioritize areas
  of funding

  * Governance Pool #3 - Gnosis Growth Fund - a funding pool, seeded with $10k and
  an additional $30k streamed into the pool over 3 months, to fund community growth
  initiatives.


  **Descriptions, eligibility requirements, visual assets, and secure pool governance
  parameters for each.**

  * Governance parameters for each of these pools can be separately customized, including:

  * voting weight system (fixed, quadratic, or 1 token = 1 vote)

  * voting allowLists (the Safe ecosystem uses its Guardian addresses and Top 50 voters
  on Snapshot for sybil protection)

  * conviction growth rate (time delay on proposal support)

  * Tribunal Safe (account that rules on proposal disputes)

  * GNO stake required to join


  **Work to be completed by the Gardens team**

  Unless there are substantial changes to the setup above requested by the Gnosis
  DAO community, Gardens will resource this work with its own funding:

  * Draft a community Covenant with feedback from Gnosis DAO delegates.

  * Creation of the Gardens community governed by GNO.

  * Setup and activation of governance pools to be run.

  * Marketing and communications to onboard members and proposals into the community.

  * A report following the pilot with results on the projects funded and participation
  metrics from the community.


  **Requests of Gnosis DAO to help with this pilot**

  * $40k in funding, sent to the elected Council Safe that will moderate the community

  * Amplification of announcements to help recruit members, proposals, and voters

  * Feedback on the proposed setup and suggestions for improvement to better address
  Gnosis DAO’s needs


  Gardens Core is motivated to resource this work based on the demand in Gnosis DAO
  for more participatory governance solutions, and the likelihood of the program’s
  success leading to additional funding.'
