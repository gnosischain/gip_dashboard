body: "# Summary\nThis is a redo of the proposal for [GIP-87](https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0xff4bc12a163ba195f74708aa0fedab200ba8f4f4be64d1d7685b1796cd40785f)\
  \ as the attached transactions were not executed in time, and have subsequently\
  \ expired. \n\nThis procedural vote enables the payload from the successful proposal\
  \ to be executed. The original specifications remain unchanged and can be seen in\
  \ the approved [GIP-87](https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0xff4bc12a163ba195f74708aa0fedab200ba8f4f4be64d1d7685b1796cd40785f\
