title: Should GnosisDAO fund RnDAO's Community Health analytics and benchmarking tool?
body: "##  Simple Summary\n\nIf Web3 is all about communities, how do we know if we’re\
  \ heading in the right direction?\n\nWe’ve been advancing a research project to:\n\
  \n  * develop a framework for Community Health with actionable metrics\n  * create\
  \ an open source data collection tool\n  * implement the tool in GnosisDAO and others\n\
  \  * analyse the interactions and perceptions data to validate the framework and\
  \ provide insights to advance the Gnosis community.\n\n\n\nWe’re seeking $30,000\
  \ or equivalent as grant match-funding to complete the project.\n\n##  About RnDAO\n\
  \nWe’re an R&D DAO with a mission to empower humane collaboration. Having already\
  \ delivered research projects on sub-DAOs and DAO Conceptual Foundations , Decentralised\
  \ Leadership, DAO Compensation , and more .\n\n##  Abstract\n\nLike many others,\
  \ Gnosis depends on the health of its community and its vibez—yet understanding\
  \ and measuring these factors (what we call Community Health) is challenging.\n\n\
  Today, Web3 communities are left to rely on infrequent transactions data (on-chain\
  \ records), while data from the significantly more frequent social interactions\
  \ is limited to basic indicators of Discord or Discourse, Web2-oriented bots like\
  \ Statsbot that give simplistic measurements, or a patchwork of “homemade” surveys\
  \ to fill in the gaps. These solutions are ill-suited for DAO communities, surveys\
  \ are time-consuming for community managers and contributors to use, and the results\
  \ of these approaches, hampered by poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable.\n\
  \nPerhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves DAO community leaders\
  \ and members without established baselines to measure against to understand the\
  \ impact of community-focused initiatives, identify best practices, monitor shocks\
  \ to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes (such as market\
  \ crashes, protocol migrations, etc.).\n\n##  Motivation\n\nTo advance the Gnosis\
  \ ecosystem by supporting a humane understanding of DAOs, enabling community managers,\
  \ leaders and members to better understand and support the wellbeing of communities\
  \ and know what’s helping and what’s hindering them. Ultimately leading to a more\
  \ resilient and successful Gnosis ecosystem.\n\n##  Specification\n\nFor the conceptual\
  \ framework, we have assembled a team including two PhDs in network science and\
  \ an organisation designer with significant DAO and community building experience\
  \ (myself) to bridge both theory and practice. We’ve reviewed over 50 papers on\
  \ the topics of Community, Social Network Analysis, Resilience, Trust, Engagement,\
  \ and more. And are synthesising all of these findings to define the key indicators\
  \ that have high validity and high predictive capacity for community health, while\
  \ also taking a holistic perspective that accounts for member’s wellbeing and planning\
  \ to collect data across communities to offer an ecosystem health scrore too.\n\n\
  For the data collection tool, we’re going beyond traditional surveys.\n\nThis research\
  \ proposal focuses on the use of two critical techniques as a starting point:\n\n\
  Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) is a structured way to visualize how communications,\
  \ information, and value creation occur through an organization based on interaction\
  \ graphs. ONA has been shown to provide a wide range of insights to improve contributor\
  \ retention, avoid member burnout, predict team performance and community resilience,\
  \ identify key contributors, enable decentralization, and improve coordination.\
  \ Although relatively new, ONA is gaining in popularity over traditional survey\
  \ tools.\n\nPulse Surveys are frequent and automated micro-surveys that provide\
  \ qualitative and quantitative insights. In traditional organizations, they have\
  \ been shown to increase employee response rate and employee engagement with related\
  \ initiatives. They’re also used as a tool for culture design and implementing culture\
  \ change. Lastly, Pulse Surveys significantly reduce admin work for community managers\
  \ and related roles.\n\nThe data is anonymised and collected in a central repository\
  \ for this first phase (we’re exploring decentralised hosting) and managed by a\
  \ team having received ethics training and at risk of losing their credentials should\
  \ it be misused.\n\n##  Rationale\n\nThe techniques used (ONA based on communication\
  \ and Pulse Surveys) provide maximum insights on Community Health compared with\
  \ exclusively on-chain data analysis. And provide minimum disruption for community\
  \ members and minimal admin compared to long-form surveys and user interviews. Crucially,\
  \ the techniques selected and the usage of Discord messages increase participation\
  \ by those less likely to respond to long survey e.g. those less engaged and thus\
  \ likely with the most valuable feedback to give.\n\nAlthough our initial focus\
  \ is Community Health metrics, the proposed approach sets the foundation for further\
  \ applications. The combination of ONA and pulse surveys offers unprecedented actionable\
  \ insights in real-time. Some of the potential applications and insights for Gnosis\
  \ DAO and Gnosis-Chain-based DAOs are:\n\n  * Generate baseline metrics for Community\
  \ Health / vibez to quantify and better understand the impact that a specific event\
  \ is having on a community and/or sub-groups within the community\n  * Predict which\
  \ contributors are likely to leave the DAO and take preventive action (without breaching\
  \ privacy)\n  * Build funnels to track member onboarding and identify areas for\
  \ improvement\n  * Identify measurements of decentralization to serve as KPIs or\
  \ Insights metrics\n  * Monitor specific topics like contributor wellbeing, alignment,\
  \ community experience, etc. in near real-time\n  * Attract talent and investment\
  \ with objective Community Health metrics instead of proxy metrics like member count\
  \ or proposal count, or financial metrics such as TVL\n  * Help new contributors\
  \ find context-rich mentors outside of the existing pool of well-known but time-poor\
  \ candidates\n\n\n\nIn addition to the initial research on Community Health, the\
  \ potential applications mentioned above (and others to be found) can enable more\
  \ effective and targeted efforts to build healthier DAO communities.\n\nThis research\
  \ also helps reduce the tooling gap in DAOs compared to the employee and stakeholder\
  \ experience at traditional corporations.\n\n##  Why our Team?\n\nWe combine deep\
  \ expertise in Network Science and Organisational Network Mapping, Business Intelligence,\
  \ DAOs and Community Building.\n\nTeam Leads\n\nKaterinabc  \nPh.D. in Team Dynamics\
