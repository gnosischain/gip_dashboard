  \ communities, how do we know if we’re heading in the right direction?\n\nWe’ve\
  \ been advancing a research project to:\n\n  * develop a framework for Community\
  \ Health with actionable metrics\n  * create an open source data collection tool\n\
  \  * implement the tool in GnosisDAO and others\n  * analyse the interactions and\
  \ perceptions data to validate the framework and provide insights to advance the\
  \ Gnosis community.\n\n\n\nWe’re seeking $30,000 or equivalent as grant match-funding\
  \ to complete the project.\n\n##  About RnDAO\n\nWe’re an R&D DAO with a mission\
  \ to empower humane collaboration. Having already delivered research projects on\
  \ sub-DAOs and DAO Conceptual Foundations , Decentralised Leadership, DAO Compensation\
  \ , and more .\n\n##  Abstract\n\nLike many others, Gnosis depends on the health\
  \ of its community and its vibez—yet understanding and measuring these factors (what\
  \ we call Community Health) is challenging.\n\nToday, Web3 communities are left\
  \ to rely on infrequent transactions data (on-chain records), while data from the\
  \ significantly more frequent social interactions is limited to basic indicators\
  \ of Discord or Discourse, Web2-oriented bots like Statsbot that give simplistic\
  \ measurements, or a patchwork of “homemade” surveys to fill in the gaps. These\
  \ solutions are ill-suited for DAO communities, surveys are time-consuming for community\
  \ managers and contributors to use, and the results of these approaches, hampered\
  \ by poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable.\n\nPerhaps even direr,\
  \ the lack of real-time analytics leaves DAO community leaders and members without\
  \ established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused\
  \ initiatives, identify best practices, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly\
  \ gauge the effects of system-wide changes (such as market crashes, protocol migrations,\
  \ etc.).\n\n##  Motivation\n\nTo advance the Gnosis ecosystem by supporting a humane\
  \ understanding of DAOs, enabling community managers, leaders and members to better\
  \ understand and support the wellbeing of communities and know what’s helping and\
  \ what’s hindering them. Ultimately leading to a more resilient and successful Gnosis\
  \ ecosystem.\n\n##  Specification\n\nFor the conceptual framework, we have assembled\
  \ a team including two PhDs in network science and an organisation designer with\
  \ significant DAO and community building experience (myself) to bridge both theory\
  \ and practice. We’ve reviewed over 50 papers on the topics of Community, Social\
  \ Network Analysis, Resilience, Trust, Engagement, and more. And are synthesising\
  \ all of these findings to define the key indicators that have high validity and\
  \ high predictive capacity for community health, while also taking a holistic perspective\
  \ that accounts for member’s wellbeing and planning to collect data across communities\
  \ to offer an ecosystem health scrore too.\n\nFor the data collection tool, we’re\
  \ going beyond traditional surveys.\n\nThis research proposal focuses on the use\
  \ of two critical techniques as a starting point:\n\nOrganizational Network Analysis\
  \ (ONA) is a structured way to visualize how communications, information, and value\
  \ creation occur through an organization based on interaction graphs. ONA has been\
  \ shown to provide a wide range of insights to improve contributor retention, avoid\
  \ member burnout, predict team performance and community resilience, identify key\
  \ contributors, enable decentralization, and improve coordination. Although relatively\
  \ new, ONA is gaining in popularity over traditional survey tools.\n\nPulse Surveys\
  \ are frequent and automated micro-surveys that provide qualitative and quantitative\
  \ insights. In traditional organizations, they have been shown to increase employee\
  \ response rate and employee engagement with related initiatives. They’re also used\
  \ as a tool for culture design and implementing culture change. Lastly, Pulse Surveys\
  \ significantly reduce admin work for community managers and related roles.\n\n\
  The data is anonymised and collected in a central repository for this first phase\
  \ (we’re exploring decentralised hosting) and managed by a team having received\
  \ ethics training and at risk of losing their credentials should it be misused.\n\
  \n##  Rationale\n\nThe techniques used (ONA based on communication and Pulse Surveys)\
  \ provide maximum insights on Community Health compared with exclusively on-chain\
  \ data analysis. And provide minimum disruption for community members and minimal\
  \ admin compared to long-form surveys and user interviews. Crucially, the techniques\
  \ selected and the usage of Discord messages increase participation by those less\
  \ likely to respond to long survey e.g. those less engaged and thus likely with\
  \ the most valuable feedback to give.\n\nAlthough our initial focus is Community\
  \ Health metrics, the proposed approach sets the foundation for further applications.\
  \ The combination of ONA and pulse surveys offers unprecedented actionable insights\
  \ in real-time. Some of the potential applications and insights for Gnosis DAO and\
  \ Gnosis-Chain-based DAOs are:\n\n  * Generate baseline metrics for Community Health\
  \ / vibez to quantify and better understand the impact that a specific event is\
  \ having on a community and/or sub-groups within the community\n  * Predict which\
  \ contributors are likely to leave the DAO and take preventive action (without breaching\
  \ privacy)\n  * Build funnels to track member onboarding and identify areas for\
  \ improvement\n  * Identify measurements of decentralization to serve as KPIs or\
  \ Insights metrics\n  * Monitor specific topics like contributor wellbeing, alignment,\
  \ community experience, etc. in near real-time\n  * Attract talent and investment\
  \ with objective Community Health metrics instead of proxy metrics like member count\
  \ or proposal count, or financial metrics such as TVL\n  * Help new contributors\
  \ find context-rich mentors outside of the existing pool of well-known but time-poor\
  \ candidates\n\n\n\nIn addition to the initial research on Community Health, the\
  \ potential applications mentioned above (and others to be found) can enable more\
  \ effective and targeted efforts to build healthier DAO communities.\n\nThis research\
  \ also helps reduce the tooling gap in DAOs compared to the employee and stakeholder\
  \ experience at traditional corporations.\n\n##  Why our Team?\n\nWe combine deep\
  \ expertise in Network Science and Organisational Network Mapping, Business Intelligence,\
  \ DAOs and Community Building.\n\nTeam Leads\n\nKaterinabc  \nPh.D. in Team Dynamics\
