title: Should GnosisDAO Reinstate Full Rewards for Eligible GnosisVIP Validator Nodes?
body: "#### Category\n\nFunding - Rewards\n\n#### Executive Summary:\n\nThis proposal\
  \ aims to revisit and restore the original reward policy for the GnosisVIP event.\
  \ The event’s initial rules allowed participants to set up validator nodes across\
  \ 104 countries, with the first 10 nodes in each country being eligible for rewards.\
  \ The original rules can be reviewed here.\n\nGnosisVIP is getting concluded due\
  \ to the retirement of Builders Team which launched this event. However, the team\
  \ that took over the reward distribution decided to cut down the rewards for participants\
  \ who run more than one validators, citing concerns about farming. The announcement\
  \ can be found here.\n\nSince there is no restriction in the rules against multiple\
  \ validator nodes with unique IP addresses, and all those eligible validators contribute\
  \ equally to geo-diversity in this event, this proposal seeks to ensure participants\
  \ receive the full rewards as originally promised. This will maintain fairness and\
  \ trust within the Gnosis community.\n\n#### Specification\n\nThe proposed reward\
  \ program aims to restore the original terms of the GnosisVIP event:\n\n  * Full\
  \ Rewards for Eligible Nodes: All validator nodes that meet the criteria (first\
  \ 10 in their respective countries) should receive their promised rewards according\
  \ to their validating duration, irrespective of whether they are run by the same\
  \ entity.\n\n\n\nThis approach will help the broader Gnosis ecosystem by maintaining\
  \ predictability and trust within the Gnosis community.\n\n#### Rationale\n\nThe\
  \ motivation behind this proposal is to uphold fairness and trust within the Gnosis\
  \ community. The original rules did not prohibit running multiple nodes from different\
  \ IP addresses, and participants should be rewarded based on those terms. Changing\
  \ the reward policy retroactively undermines trust and can discourage future participation.\n\
  \n#### Budget\n\nAccording to the google sheet in the sunsetting announcement, a\
  \ total of 16 validators from 10 participants are affected by the reduced rewards.\n\
  \nThe expected amount of rewards to make up is as follows:\n\nWithdrawal Address\
  \ | Affected Validators | Duration | Affected Rewards | Notes  \n---|---|---|---|---\
  \  \n…6b20 | 1 | 9 Mo | 5.25 GNO |   \n…4cd8 | 1 | 12 Mo | 10.5 GNO |   \n…bc0c\
  \ | 1 | 12 Mo | 10.5 GNO |   \n…02fc | 1 | 12 Mo | 10.5 GNO |   \n…9bc1 | 2 | 6\
  \ Mo | 4.8 GNO |   \n…20a0 | 3 | 12 Mo | 35.7 GNO |   \n…db02 | 1 | 9 Mo | 5.25\
  \ GNO |   \n…ab14 | 2 | 12 Mo | 23.8 GNO |   \n…4765 | 1 | 6 Mo | 2.25 GNO |   \n\
  …a88a | 3 | 6 Mo | 7.65 GNO | *Newly Added  \n**Total** | **16** |  | **116.2 GNO**\
  \ |   \n  \nEdit: The google sheet seems updated after initially drafting this post,\
  \ updated the numbers to match that.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nRestoring the original\
  \ GnosisVIP rewards policy is essential for maintaining fairness and trust within\
  \ the community. By honoring the original rules, we can ensure that all participants\
  \ are treated equitably and avoid reputational risk for the Gnosis ecosystem. This\
  \ proposal seeks the support of the GnosisDAO community to uphold the integrity\
  \ of our events and promote a decentralized and robust network.\n\n2 Likes\n\nStaworth\
