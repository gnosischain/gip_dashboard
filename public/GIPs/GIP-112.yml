title: Should the Gnosis Infrastructure team make changes to the GnosisDAO’s Snapshot
  configurations?
body: "# Executive Summary\nThe Gnosis Infrastructure team is aiming to improve data\
  \ availability for the GnosisDAO’s subgraphs being consumed by the Snapshot Space.\n\
  \n- As part of the task there is a need for adopting the right indexing solution\
  \ which must provide highly available data for the subgraphs running on Gnosis Chain\
  \ and Ethereum Mainnet which, in turn, are consumed by the Snapshot space.\n- There\
  \ is a need for improving the current Snapshot strategy called GNO voting power,\
  \ which needs to reflect all the available options such as GNO deposits made through\
  \ Safe sponsored calls that allows locked GNO to be used for voting.\n- GIP-101\
  \ passed and requires weighted choice voting for the community to elect 10 delegate\
  \ candidates. However, weighted choice voting is not compatible with the Reality.eth\
  \ module used to power the GnosisDAO’s Snapshot space. The most viable solution\
  \ is to open an official Snapshot sub-space with weighted choice voting enabled.\
  \ In addition to updating the Snapshot subgraphs detailed above, the Gnosis Infrastructure\
  \ team will open a Snapshot sub-space to enable weighted choice voting should this\
  \ proposal pass quorum.\n\n# Introduction\nThe GnosisDAO's Snapshot space needs\
  \ to be monitored and maintained by the Gnosis Infrastructure team. Issues that\
  \ can arise are most often related to The Graph's subgraph indexer for Snapshot.\
  \ The Snapshot Subgraph is a powerful tool that efficiently organizes and indexes\
  \ on-chain governance events sourced from the Snapshot DAO client.\n\nThe recent\
  \ issues with the latest GIPs were related to the subgraphs indexer, which had stopped\
  \ working. The subgraphs are hosted by The Graph and will be deprecated To if they\
  \ are not updated.\n\nCommunity members also surfaced issues related to voting with\
  \ their staked GNO further indicating that there was a subgraph issue.\n\nhttps://forum.gnosis.io/t/bug-in-the-snapshot-voting-power-calculation/8395\n\
  \nGnosis DevOps initiated a review of all Snapshot configurations and found that\
  \ **the GnosisDAO's multisig owners would need to sign off on updating the settings\
  \ for the DAO's Snapshot.**\n\n# Proposed Changes\nThe subgraphs for GNO voting\
  \ power, which are currently running as best effort on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain,\
  \ will necessarily need to be re-deployed on The Graph Decentralized network. As\
  \ a result of the re-deploy process a new value for the SUBGRAPH_URL in the Snapshot\
  \ space configuration will be generated.\n\nThis value must be filled in the Snapshot\
  \ configuration. Any modifications to the GnosisDAO’s Snapshot settings must be\
  \ voted on by the DAO and executed via the DAO’s multi-sig.\n\n# Impact and Benefits\n\
  Updating the Snapshot configurations to install a new Graph API URL will improve\
  \ data availability for the GnosisDAO’s subgraphs being consumed by the Snapshot\
  \ Space. The Infrastructure team will also improve the current Snapshot strategy\
  \ called GNO voting power so that locked GNO from GIP-28 can participate in GnosisDAO\
  \ governance. \n\nhttps://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-28-allow-gno-holders-to-vote-even-if-their-gno-are-invested-staked-locked-in-smart-contracts-in-different-protocols-networks/2357\n\
  \n# Implementation Plan\nPlease provide a detailed plan for implementing the proposed\
  \ changes, including timelines, key milestones, and any necessary resources or support.\n\
  \nThe Gnosis Infrastructure team will be working on fixing the most impacting issues\
  \ with the subgraph, among which we have:\n\n1. Migration to the Decentralized Network\n\
  Objective: Transition the existing subgraph from the hosted service to the Decentralized\
  \ Network ahead of the service's deprecation to ensure continued functionality and\
  \ support by migrating to a more sustainable and decentralized service. **This is\
  \ a high priority and time sensitive task that needs to be carried out asap due\
  \ to TheGraph hosted service being deprecated definitely by September 14th 2024.**\n\
  \n2. Refresh of Voting Power Strategy\nObjective: Revise the voting power calculation\
  \ to align with current blockchain usage and protocol engagement. Accurately reflect\
  \ the active protocols and eliminate outdated or less utilized ones, enhancing the\
  \ relevance and fairness of voting power metrics. \n\nAdditionally, voting power\
  \ must account for:\n- Beacon chain withdrawals\n- Have the withdrawal address accruing\
  \ the voting power as opposed to the deposit address\n- osGNO\n- osGNO-GNO Balancer/Aura\
  \ pool\n\nThe Infrastructure team will remove support for:\n\n- 1Hive (Gnosis)\n\
  - Swapper (Gnosis)\n- SushiSwap (Gnosis)\n- Elk (Gnosis)\n- Baoswap (Gnosis)\n-\
  \ Symmetric (Gnosis)\n- Uni v3 (mainnet)\n- Balancer (mainnet)\n\n3. Fixes and Enhancements\
  \ in Voting Power Calculation\nObjective: Correct and refine the calculation issues\
  \ leading to inaccurate voting scores on some indexed protocols in order to keep\
  \ fairness of the voting process. Please see previous DAO votes covering the topic\
  \ of allowing locked GNO to vote on Snapshot for more info.\n\n- Withdrawal event\
  \ of the Gnosis Beacon Chain Deposit smart contract was not handled correctly resulting\
  \ in a wrong tracking of deposited GNO over the network. This issue is considered\
  \ as critical as it could lead to vote power farming. Currently it’s not trivial\
  \ to detect if a withdrawal is for claiming reward or for exit validator without\
  \ tracking the Execution Layer (that is not possible in the subgraph). We decided\
  \ to consider all withdrawals as an exit, even though this means we're not accounting\
  \ for rewards generated over time. While this isn't ideal, it's the best solution\
  \ we have at the moment to prevent abuse.\n\nOur technical team is actively working\
  \ on a better and more accurate solution, and we plan to update the system in the\
  \ coming weeks.\n\n- Fixing the issue with the Deposit event of the Gnosis Beacon\
  \ Chain Deposit smart contract incorrectly handled, which was causing some issues\
  \ with how voting power was being assigned. Specifically, the problem affected services\
  \ like Gelato Network, where the voting power was incorrectly being assigned to\
  \ the service itself rather than to the user.\n\nForum threads:\n- https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-allow-to-use-gno-locked-in-balancer-pools-for-voting-in-snapshot-proposals/902\n\

  All the changes will be handled publicly on the following repository: https://github.com/gnosis/subgraph-voting-power\n\
  \nThe subgraphs will be owned by a Safe on Arbitrum (arb1:0x67cE12b820ea02f045e2507648608442C6527c6C)\
  \ having the Infrastructure team as owners. Subgraphs will be publicly available\
  \ on this page: https://thegraph.com/explorer/profile/0x67cE12b820ea02f045e2507648608442C6527c6C?view=Subgraphs&chain=arbitrum-one\n\
  \nAny updates regarding this GIP will be handled in a dedicated post in the Governance\
  \ section of the Gnosis Forum."
