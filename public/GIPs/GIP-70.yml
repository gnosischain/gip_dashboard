title: Should GnosisDAO pass a Grant Proposal to partner with Gateway.fm?
body: "Gateway.fm is a distributed blockchain infrastructure company. Our mission\
  \ is to provide enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure at scale, distributed\
  \ around the world, in a portable way. \n\nGateway.fm team should be supported with\
  \ a significant grant of 1mil DAI upfront, 2mil DAI and 20k GNO vested over 3 years\
  \ allowing us to focus on the Gnosis Chain. The vested GNO should be used for staking\
  \ on the Gnosis Beacon Chain and should only be able to be sold three years after\
  \ the agreement is in place. Gateway.fm's contributions will include but are not\
  \ limited to the following milestones: https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-70-should-gnosisdao-pass-a-grant-proposal-to-partner-with-gateway-fm/6079\n\
  \nApart from that, Gateway.fm team will be happy to support Gnosis Chain in achieving\
  \ any future goals that are within the teamâ€™s competence and we will be closely\
  \ embedded with the Gnosis teams to secure a successful path forward on the direction\
  \ of new development of the Gnosis Chain."
