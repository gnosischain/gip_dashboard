title: Should GnosisDAO support Gnosischa.in Explorer hosted by beaconcha.in?
body: "**Gnosischa.in** by beaconcha.in\n\nhttps://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-74-should-gnosisdao-support-gnosischa-in-explorer-hosted-by-beaconcha-in/6228/2\n\
  \n**Description**\n\nGnosischa.in is an open source explorer that provides users\
  \ with an easy and accessible way to explore the gnosis-chain. Our explorer is designed\
  \ to be user-friendly, making it accessible to non-technical users. In addition\
  \ to our web-based explorer, we also offer an open source mobile app for iOS and\
  \ Android, providing users with the ability to monitor their validators on the go.\n\
  \nOur goal is to make it easy for anyone to access and understand the data on the\
  \ gnosis-chain, regardless of their technical expertise.\n\nGnosischa.in will be\
  \ maintained by bitfly which also operates beaconcha.in, Ethermine Staking, Ethpool\
  \ and several mining pools.\n\nWe have a deep understanding of the challenges and\
  \ opportunities in this space and are confident in our ability to deliver value\
  \ to users of the gnosis chain.\n\n**Project Details**\n\nGnosischa.in – One of\
  \ our key features is the integration of both the consensus layer and the execution\
  \ layer in a single explorer. This allows users to easily access and analyze data\
  \ from both layers, providing a more comprehensive view of the gnosis chain.\n\n\
  In addition to that, it has a mobile app for stakers to monitor their validators\
  \ & machines.\n\n**Product Features**\n\nBeaconcha.in's first-party integration\
  \ with its ecosystem will enable current beaconcha.in premium users to access premium\
  \ features on the mobile app, as well as API access to gnosischa.in and vice versa.\n\
