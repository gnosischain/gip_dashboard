title: Should GnosisDAO adopt and support Curia Lab's Governance Monitoring Service
  in 2025? - Governance - Gnosis
body: "## Executive Summary\n\nIn recent years, DAOs like Gnosis have grown significantly,\
  \ launching impactful initiatives and expanding their communities. However, as these\
  \ decentralized organizations scale, maintaining secure, transparent, and accessible\
  \ governance becomes increasingly crucial. GnosisDAO currently faces governance\
  \ challenges, including declining voter participation, delegate accountability,\
  \ transparency gaps, and a high concentration of voting power. Addressing these\
  \ effectively requires comprehensive governance research supported by specialized\
  \ analytics.\n\nCuria Lab proposes a comprehensive **Governance Monitoring & Analytics\
  \ Service** tailored specifically for GnosisDAO. The initiative begins with thorough\
  \ research into existing governance dynamics, delegate behaviors, voter participation\
  \ trends, and centralization risks. Insights from this research will inform the\
  \ development of targeted analytics tools and reports to empower the GnosisDAO community,\
  \ enhance governance transparency, and facilitate effective decision-making. Our\
  \ goal is to ensure GnosisDAO’s governance remains transparent, measurable, accountable,\
  \ and resilient, aligning with the DAO’s mission of sustainable, decentralized excellence.\n\
  \n## Motivation\n\nGnosisDAO currently faces critical governance challenges, including\
  \ declining voter engagement and frequent difficulties achieving quorum on key proposals.\
  \ In the past year, four proposals failed to meet quorum requirements, and eight\
  \ others narrowly succeeded, surpassing quorum thresholds by only 1-3%. In response\
  \ to these challenges, GnosisDAO introduced the Delegate Program (GIP-101) to enhance\
  \ participation. Despite this initiative, ongoing difficulties remain in effectively\
  \ monitoring delegate accountability and accurately measuring the program’s impact\
  \ on governance participation.\n\nTransparency is another significant concern, as\
  \ DAO members often struggle to track governance dynamics effectively. Existing\
  \ tools such as Snapshot and the GIP dashboard offer basic functionality but lack\
  \ comprehensive analytics, critical governance metrics, and historical data insights\
  \ needed for proactive and informed governance management especially in tracking\
  \ the impact of future governance-related initiatives.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\
  \nWe propose a robust **Governance Monitoring & Analytics Service** that continuously\
  \ tracks, analyzes, and reports on key governance activities. This integrated solution\
  \ comprises:\n\n  * **Governance Analytics hub**\n  * **Governance Research & Data\
  \ Reports**\n  * **Data & API Provider**\n\n\n\nTailored specifically to GnosisDAO’s\
  \ governance needs, this service provides comprehensive, actionable insights into\
  \ delegate behaviors, voter participation trends, voting power distribution, and\
  \ governance risks. By leveraging near real-time data feeds, GnosisDAO will benefit\
  \ from improved delegate accountability, informed strategic decisions, and proactive\
  \ risk monitoring.\n\nOur overarching vision is to serve as an open **end-to-end\
  \ governance data & insight provider**, ensuring DAO governance is transparent,\
  \ measurable, and secure—fully aligned with GnosisDAO’s objectives for increased\
  \ participation and sustainable governance excellence.\n\n### Governance Analytics\
  \ Hub\n\nA comprehensive analytics tool that visualizes key governance metrics using\
  \ both **onchain and offchain data** (e.g., forum interactions, forum thread analysis,\
  \ voting activity, token distribution).\n\nKey Metrics Tracking Include:\n\nHolder\
  \ Metrics: It helps us understand the distribution and dynamics of GNO token holders\
  \ and assess overall involvement to determine whether more token holders should\
  \ be encouraged to participate.\n\n  * **Holder Wallets:** Represents the total\
  \ count of unique wallet addresses holding or vested with the GNO token.\n  * **Token\
  \ Supply:** Displays the total amount of GNO tokens available, including both circulating\
  \ and vested tokens.\n  * **Votable Supply:** Indicates the number of tokens that\
  \ can be used to vote, including those that are vested.\n  * **Share of Votable\
  \ Supply:** The percentage of the total circulating supply that is currently delegated\
  \ and available to participate in governance votes.\n\nDelegate Metrics: It provides\
  \ insights into the role of delegates within the governance process, highlighting\
  \ their influence and activity over time. This would empowers token holders to make\
  \ informed decisions when selecting delegates and ensures that these representatives\
  \ actively serve the community.\n\n  * **Delegated Table:** Displays ranking, delegate\
  \ name, delegated tokens (% voting power), delegating address, voting turnout, and\
  \ the most recent five votes.\n  * **Voter Turnout:** Tracks individual participation\
  \ by monitoring recent proposal activity.\n  * **Delegate Profile:** A dedicated\
  \ page for each delegate, displaying all proposals they have voted on or abstained\
  \ from.\n  * **Rationale Vote:** Tracks whether a delegate only votes or also provides\
  \ a rationale and discussion for their vote, both on-chain and in forums.\n  * **Non-Conformity\
  \ Ratio:** Displays the ratio of times a delegate votes against the majority.\n\
  \  * **Delegation Tracking:** Monitors changes in the amount of delegation each\
  \ delegate receives.\n\nVoting Power Metrics: It provides insights into the distribution\
  \ of governance power by highlighting metrics such as the distinction between small\
  \ and large holders, overall voting power distribution, and levels of decentralization.\
  \ . These metrics help identify centralization risks and drive initiatives toward\
  \ a more decentralized voting landscape.\n\n  * **Delegate Nakamoto Coefficient:**\
  \ The number of top delegates required to control 50% of the votable supply.\n \
  \ * **Delegate Quorum:** The number of top delegates needed to reach the proposal\
  \ quorum.\n  * **Distribution of Voting Power:** Compares voting power between small\
  \ and large holders, including data on tokens delegated by each group, the percentage\
  \ of wallets that have delegated their voting power, and a detailed comparison of\
  \ voting power between the two groups.\n\nProposal Metrics: This section offer comprehensive\
  \ insights into governance proposals, helping GnosisDAO understand proposal dynamics,\
  \ community engagement levels, and voting outcomes.\n\n  * **Proposals Table:**\
  \ Displays all proposals with details such as name, status, outcome, and category\n\
  \nParticipation Metrics: It provides insights by identifying areas of low engagement,\
  \ highlighting opportunities to boost overall participation. These metrics also\
  \ enable detailed tracking of delegate and voter involvement, allowing the DAO to\
  \ develop targeted strategies that effectively increase governance activity.\n\n\
  \  * **Proposal Engagement Overview:** Includes unique voter counts, total voting\
  \ power used, and participation rate relative to the votable supply.\n  * **Tracking\
  \ Participation:** Monitors participation among the top 1000 delegates.\n  * **Delegated\
  \ Voting Power Analysis:** Compares voting power delegated from small versus large\
  \ holders across various delegate categories (active, inactive, ghost) and provides\
  \ a breakdown of delegators by size for each category.\n\nVoter Behavior: Voter\
  \ behavior analytics assist GnosisDAO in optimizing governance effectiveness by\
  \ pinpointing the optimal timing for voting periods to maximize participation. This\
  \ ensures critical proposals receive adequate attention at the right times, enhancing\
  \ the overall responsiveness and efficiency of governance processes.\n\n  * **Voting\
  \ Density:** A heat map showing voting density over different time periods.\n  *\
  \ **Voting Momentum:** Tracks voting momentum during various stages of the voting\
  \ cycle (early, normal, late, and ending).\n\n\n\n**Forum Contributor Analytics:**\
  \ This section provides comprehensive analytics and detailed insights into individual\
  \ contributors based on their activities and interactions within GnosisDAO forums.\
  \ These insights enhance governance decision-making by clearly highlighting user\
  \ engagement, sentiment, relationships, popularity, and key discussion themes.\n\
  \nForum Metrics (more metrics will be added overtime) \n\n  * **Activity Over Time:**\
  \ Displays user engagement levels by tracking the frequency of new topics created,\
  \ comments posted, and likes given over time, offering clear visibility into user\
  \ activity trends.\n  * **Sentiment Analysis:** Measures the overall tone and subjectivity\
  \ of a user’s contributions. This is calculated by averaging the sentiment scores\
  \ (polarity and subjectivity) from all texts authored by the user\n  * **Readability\
  \ Score:** Evaluates the clarity and ease of understanding of a user’s forum contributions\
  \ using the Flesch Reading Ease Score. Calculated similarly to sentiment analysis\
  \ by averaging readability scores from all texts written by the user:\n  * **BFFs\
  \ (Best Friends Forever):** Highlights key relationships and interactions among\
  \ users through four distinct metrics: \n    * **Most Likes Received From:** Identifies\
  \ which user gave the most likes to the target user, along with the total number\
  \ of likes.\n    * **Most Likes Given To:** Identifies which user received the most\
  \ likes from the target user, along with the total number of likes.\n    * **Most\
  \ Posts Received From:** Indicates which user most frequently commented on posts\
  \ made by the target user, including the number of comments.\n    * **Most Posts\
  \ Given To:** Indicates which user received the most comments from the target user,\
  \ including the number of comments.\n  * **Popularity:** Evaluates the user’s overall\
  \ influence within forum discussions through four metrics \n    * **Average Replies\
  \ per Topic:** Average number of replies generated by each topic created by the\
  \ user.\n    * **Average Likes Received per Topic:** Average number of likes received\
  \ on topics created by the user.\n    * **Average Likes Received per Post:** Average\
  \ number of likes received on posts/comments made by the user.\n    * **Total Likes\
  \ Received:** Total cumulative number of likes received across all topics and posts\
  \ by the user.\n  * **Word Cloud:** Visually summarizes the main discussion topics\
  \ and most frequent words used by the user. Created by combining all user-generated\
  \ text (posts and topics), preprocessing it (removing spaces, tabs, capitalization,\
  \ lemmatizing, and removing stop words), and then generating a visualization based\
  \ on the top 100 most frequently used words.\n\n\n\n**Technical Implementation Overview:**\n\
  \nWe will be developing tools that integrate data from multiple sources including\
  \ Google BigQuery, Snapshot, and various databases. Our solution features an open-source\
  \ frontend built in Next JS, which will be hosted on Vercel for optimal performance\
  \ and reliability. The backend infrastructure will be implemented using Google Cloud\
  \ services, managed through Curia’s infrastructure. We’ll develop internal tools\
  \ to support and categorize new proposals, ensuring efficient data management and\
  \ classification. The system will aggregate governance data in T-1 days, process\
  \ it through our middleware layer, and present it through an intuitive analytics\
  \ interface. This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and robust\
  \ data handling capabilities while maintaining the open-source nature of the project.\n\
