title: Allow GNO holders to vote with invested/staked/locked positions in mainnet/gc
body: 'Following from GIP-28, this proposal enables those holding and using GNO in
  a greater number of places to retain their vote in the GnosisDAO.


  Currently, the GnosisDAOâ€™s Snapshot strategy counts GNO on mainnet and Gnosis Chain,
  along with LGNO, mGNO, and some GBC staking deposits on Gnosis Chain.


  If approved, this proposal will allow users providing liquidity on various AMMs
  to retain their voting power, along with counting all GBC staking deposits.'
