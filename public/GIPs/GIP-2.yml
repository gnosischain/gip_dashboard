title: SAFE Token Model
body: "## Motivation\n\nThough we are building Gnosis Safe as an open system that\
  \ can be re-used and extended by anyone, we recognize that Gnosis still holds a\
  \ dominant position in the Safe ecosystem. The main reason for this is that Gnosis\
  \ currently holds the “trust monopoly” for the curation and promotion of all core\
  \ components of Gnosis Safe. Here are a few examples:\n\n  * **Interfaces:** Gnosis\
  \ hosts the interfaces most commonly used to interact with Gnosis Safes.\n  * **Smart\
  \ contracts:** Gnosis is the main contributor and publisher of smart contract updates.\n\
  \  * **Safe Apps:** Gnosis curates the list of Safe Apps displayed to the users\
  \ through our interfaces.\n\n\n\n## SAFE Token\n\nIn order to enshrine Gnosis Safe\
  \ as an end-to-end community project, we are proposing to launch the SAFE governance\
  \ token. We consider the SAFE Token as an essential tool to decentralize the trust\
  \ monopoly held by Gnosis. We believe this will firmly establish Gnosis Safe as\
  \ a public good and community-owned infrastructure. SAFE Tokens are not an investment\
  \ product. Instead, SAFE Token will be distributed to stakeholders of the Gnosis\
  \ Safe ecosystem that are interested in shaping the future of Gnosis Safe.\n\n![Screenshot\

  \ 2020-11-20 at 10.25.36\")\n\n## SAFE Governance\n\nWe envision the SAFE Token\
  \ will be used to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the Gnosis\
  \ Safe ecosystem, including:\n\n* * *\n\n#### Assets\n\n  * **SAFE Treasury:** SAFE\
  \ holders will be able to reward important ecosystem developments via the SAFE Treasury.\n\
  \  * **ENS domain “safe.eth”:** The ENS domain “safe.eth” will be used in the future\
  \ to point to a Safe Multisig interface deployed on IPFS, but it might be used for\
  \ other purposes as well.\n\n\n\n#### Curation\n\n  * **Safe Apps:** SAFE Token\
  \ holders will curate the list of trusted Safe Apps that appear by default in the\
  \ Gnosis Safe web interface and update existing ones to newer versions.\n  * **Safe\
  \ Contracts:** After successful audits and bug bounty periods, the community should\
  \ be vetting updates to the Safe Contracts and define which is the recommended contract\
  \ version at any point in time.\n  * **Safe Modules:** Gnosis Safe smart contracts\
  \ can be extended with modules to enable custom access/control schemes. SAFE holders\
  \ will be able to curate and validate community-built Safe Modules.\n\n\n\n####\
  \ Signaling\n\n  * **Safe Apps:** Show interest in a specific Safe App idea to educate\
  \ developers about user preference and demand.\n\n  * **Infrastructure:** Help prioritize\
  \ tasks in Safe-related Github repositories (see example).\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nThere\
  \ is no immediate need to have all activities described above to be community-governed\
  \ from day one. Rather, Gnosis will take a cautious and progressive approach, decentralizing\
  \ governance over different components successively over time to prevent any disruptions\
  \ to users. The governance process would likely be conducted using a SAFE Treasury\
  \ app that allows SAFE holders to vote on proposals. **The transition to open governance\
  \ is a long term goal, and we aim to establish a sustainable governance system that\
  \ lasts for decades.**\n\nGnosis Safe will always remain a fully self-custodial\
  \ asset management solution, in which the user is in full control. The governance\
  \ enabled through the SAFE Token is limited to curation activities and building\
  \ initiatives that drive the Gnosis Safe ecosystem forward.\n\n## SAFE Token Distribution\n\
  \n> Though the proposal is about whether a Gnosis SAFE token should be investigated,\
  \ in the following we outline specification ideas as to how such tokens could be\
  \ distributed, assuming the proposal to issue Gnosis SAFE tokens finds your support\
  \ and will end up being implemented.\n\nWhen designing the SAFE Token distribution\
  \ model, we followed this principle:\n\n* * *\n\n**Distribute the SAFE Token fairly\
  \ and sustainably across a wide range of relevant stakeholders to foster active\
  \ governance of the Gnosis Safe ecosystem.**\n\n* * *\n\nAt genesis, 1 billion SAFE\
  \ Tokens are proposed to be minted with the following distribution:\n\n  * **10%\
  \ Early Adopters (Users)**\n    * Early adopters are retrospectively awarded for\
  \ funds stored and transactions made in the past according to a predetermined formula.\
  \ Additionally, there will be an initial “liquidity mining” launch program for users.\n\
  \  * **2.5% Early Ecosystem Contributors**\n    * Early contributors are retrospectively\
  \ awarded for ecosystem contributions according to a list of contributions consolidated\
  \ by Gnosis.\n  * **25% GnosisDAO**\n    * To be decided (see options in “Benefits\
  \ for GnosisDAO Holders” section)\n  * **50% SAFE Treasury**\n    * SAFE Treasury\
  \ is a vehicle for rewarding future ecosystem contributions initially controlled\
  \ by Gnosis, but over time, it will be governed by SAFE Holders. The SAFE Treasury\
  \ would have a 10 years vesting period. It might also be an option to introduce\
  \ a yearly inflation rate of 1-3%, which would be granted to the SAFE Treasury to\
  \ sustain its ability to reward contributions beyond the vesting period.\n  * **12.5%\
  \ Gnosis Share**\n    * Gnosis Share is incentivising Gnosis and its staff as core\
  \ maintainers to have aligned incentives and long term commitment to the SAFE Token\
  \ and the Safe ecosystem. Gnosis Share would have a 5 years vesting period.\n\n\n\
  \n![imageimage1550×852 181 KB]( \"image\")\n\n## Relationship between SAFE Tokens\
  \ and GNO Tokens\n\nTo recognise the importance of GNO Tokens in the development\
  \ of Gnosis Safe, we propose that 25% of the total SAFE Token supply shall accrue\
  \ to GNO Tokens. This can be achieved through various ways, including a combination\
  \ of:\n\n  1. **Direct vesting to GnosisDAO:** SAFE Tokens are vested into the GnosisDAO\
  \ Treasury over a period of time via a vesting smart contract.\n  2. **Uniswap Pool\
  \ Liquidity Shares:** SAFE Tokens are locked in a Uniswap liquidity pool and are\
  \ matched by GnosisDAO with GNO Tokens. The resulting liquidity shares are then\
  \ split between GnosisDAO and the SAFE Treasury to assure mutual incentive alignment.\n\
  \  3. **Bonding curve:** A bonding curve is set up, issuing SAFE Tokens for GNO\
  \ Tokens at an increasing exchange rate. If demand for SAFE Tokens increases, this\
  \ results in an increased demand for GNO Tokens.\n  4. **Initial price finding and\
  \ aligning interest:** To find a fair initial price, we propose to conduct an initial\
  \ price finding for GnosisDAO’s SAFE Token share on Mesa. The GNO Tokens received\
  \ through this are given to the SAFE Treasury to ensure their aligned interest with\
  \ GnosisDAO.\n\n\n\n## Which options do you approve?\n\n  * Direct Vesting\n  *\

  \n> ## Disclaimer\n> \n> The plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion\
  \ and change. They may also need to be (re)structured to take account of legal,\
  \ regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This\
  \ document should not be taken as the basis for making investment decisions, nor\
  \ be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions. You are solely\
  \ responsible for your own investment decisions and transactions.\n\n3 Likes\n\n\
