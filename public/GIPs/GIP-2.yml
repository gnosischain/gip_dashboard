title: SAFE Token Model
body: "## Motivation\n\nThough we are building Gnosis Safe as an open system that\
  \ can be re-used and extended by anyone, we recognize that Gnosis still holds a\
  \ dominant position in the Safe ecosystem. The main reason for this is that Gnosis\
  \ currently holds the “trust monopoly” for the curation and promotion of all core\
  \ components of Gnosis Safe. Here are a few examples:\n\n  * **Interfaces:** Gnosis\
  \ hosts the interfaces most commonly used to interact with Gnosis Safes.\n  * **Smart\
  \ contracts:** Gnosis is the main contributor and publisher of smart contract updates.\n\
  \  * **Safe Apps:** Gnosis curates the list of Safe Apps displayed to the users\
  \ through our interfaces.\n\n\n\n## SAFE Token\n\nIn order to enshrine Gnosis Safe\
  \ as an end-to-end community project, we are proposing to launch the SAFE governance\
  \ token. We consider the SAFE Token as an essential tool to decentralize the trust\
  \ monopoly held by Gnosis. We believe this will firmly establish Gnosis Safe as\
  \ a public good and community-owned infrastructure. SAFE Tokens are not an investment\
  \ product. Instead, SAFE Token will be distributed to stakeholders of the Gnosis\
  \ Safe ecosystem that are interested in shaping the future of Gnosis Safe.\n\n[![Screenshot\

  \ \"Screenshot 2020-11-20 at 10.25.36\")\n\n## SAFE Governance\n\nWe envision the\
  \ SAFE Token will be used to govern and curate essential infrastructure components\
  \ of the Gnosis Safe ecosystem, including:\n\n* * *\n\n#### Assets\n\n  * **SAFE\
  \ Treasury:** SAFE holders will be able to reward important ecosystem developments\
  \ via the SAFE Treasury.\n  * **ENS domain “safe.eth”:** The ENS domain “safe.eth”\
  \ will be used in the future to point to a Safe Multisig interface deployed on IPFS,\
  \ but it might be used for other purposes as well.\n\n\n\n#### Curation\n\n  * **Safe\
  \ Apps:** SAFE Token holders will curate the list of trusted Safe Apps that appear\
  \ by default in the Gnosis Safe web interface and update existing ones to newer\
  \ versions.\n  * **Safe Contracts:** After successful audits and bug bounty periods,\
  \ the community should be vetting updates to the Safe Contracts and define which\
  \ is the recommended contract version at any point in time.\n  * **Safe Modules:**\
  \ Gnosis Safe smart contracts can be extended with modules to enable custom access/control\
  \ schemes. SAFE holders will be able to curate and validate community-built Safe\
  \ Modules.\n\n\n\n#### Signaling\n\n  * **Safe Apps:** Show interest in a specific\
  \ Safe App idea to educate developers about user preference and demand.\n\n  * **Infrastructure:**\
  \ Help prioritize tasks in Safe-related Github repositories ([see example](https://tokenlog.xyz/gnosis/safe-react)).\n\
  \n\n\n\n* * *\n\nThere is no immediate need to have all activities described above\
  \ to be community-governed from day one. Rather, Gnosis will take a cautious and\
  \ progressive approach, decentralizing governance over different components successively\
  \ over time to prevent any disruptions to users. The governance process would likely\
  \ be conducted using a SAFE Treasury app that allows SAFE holders to vote on proposals.\
  \ **The transition to open governance is a long term goal, and we aim to establish\
  \ a sustainable governance system that lasts for decades.**\n\nGnosis Safe will\
  \ always remain a fully self-custodial asset management solution, in which the user\
  \ is in full control. The governance enabled through the SAFE Token is limited to\
  \ curation activities and building initiatives that drive the Gnosis Safe ecosystem\
  \ forward.\n\n## SAFE Token Distribution\n\n> Though the proposal is about whether\
  \ a Gnosis SAFE token should be investigated, in the following we outline specification\
  \ ideas as to how such tokens could be distributed, assuming the proposal to issue\
  \ Gnosis SAFE tokens finds your support and will end up being implemented.\n\nWhen\
  \ designing the SAFE Token distribution model, we followed this principle:\n\n*\
  \ * *\n\n**Distribute the SAFE Token fairly and sustainably across a wide range\
  \ of relevant stakeholders to foster active governance of the Gnosis Safe ecosystem.**\n\
  \n* * *\n\nAt genesis, 1 billion SAFE Tokens are proposed to be minted with the\
  \ following distribution:\n\n  * **10% Early Adopters (Users)**\n    * Early adopters\
  \ are retrospectively awarded for funds stored and transactions made in the past\
  \ according to a predetermined formula. Additionally, there will be an initial “liquidity\
  \ mining” launch program for users.\n  * **2.5% Early Ecosystem Contributors**\n\
  \    * Early contributors are retrospectively awarded for ecosystem contributions\
  \ according to a list of contributions consolidated by Gnosis.\n  * **25% GnosisDAO**\n\
  \    * To be decided (see options in “Benefits for GnosisDAO Holders” section)\n\
  \  * **50% SAFE Treasury**\n    * SAFE Treasury is a vehicle for rewarding future\
  \ ecosystem contributions initially controlled by Gnosis, but over time, it will\
  \ be governed by SAFE Holders. The SAFE Treasury would have a 10 years vesting period.\
  \ It might also be an option to introduce a yearly inflation rate of 1-3%, which\
  \ would be granted to the SAFE Treasury to sustain its ability to reward contributions\
  \ beyond the vesting period.\n  * **12.5% Gnosis Share**\n    * Gnosis Share is\
  \ incentivising Gnosis and its staff as core maintainers to have aligned incentives\
  \ and long term commitment to the SAFE Token and the Safe ecosystem. Gnosis Share\
  \ would have a 5 years vesting period.\n\n\n\n[![image](https://forum.gnosis.io/uploads/default/optimized/1X/21a6da3cd57feede46970646e10c5305ffd8284d_2_690x379.jpeg)image1550×852\

  \ \"image\")\n\n## Relationship between SAFE Tokens and GNO Tokens\n\nTo recognise\
  \ the importance of GNO Tokens in the development of Gnosis Safe, we propose that\
  \ 25% of the total SAFE Token supply shall accrue to GNO Tokens. This can be achieved\
  \ through various ways, including a combination of:\n\n  1. **Direct vesting to\
  \ GnosisDAO:** SAFE Tokens are vested into the GnosisDAO Treasury over a period\
  \ of time via a vesting smart contract.\n  2. **Uniswap Pool Liquidity Shares:**\
  \ SAFE Tokens are locked in a Uniswap liquidity pool and are matched by GnosisDAO\
  \ with GNO Tokens. The resulting liquidity shares are then split between GnosisDAO\
  \ and the SAFE Treasury to assure mutual incentive alignment.\n  3. **Bonding curve:**\
  \ A bonding curve is set up, issuing SAFE Tokens for GNO Tokens at an increasing\
  \ exchange rate. If demand for SAFE Tokens increases, this results in an increased\
  \ demand for GNO Tokens.\n  4. **Initial price finding and aligning interest:**\
  \ To find a fair initial price, we propose to conduct an initial price finding for\
  \ GnosisDAO’s SAFE Token share on [Mesa](https://mesa.eth.link/). The GNO Tokens\
  \ received through this are given to the SAFE Treasury to ensure their aligned interest\
  \ with GnosisDAO.\n\n\n\n## Which options do you approve?\n\n  * Direct Vesting\n\
  \  * Uniswap LP Shares\n  * Bonding Curve\n  * Initial Price Finding\n\n\n\n0 voters\n\
  \n> ## Disclaimer\n> \n> The plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion\
  \ and change. They may also need to be (re)structured to take account of legal,\
  \ regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This\
  \ document should not be taken as the basis for making investment decisions, nor\
  \ be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions. You are solely\
  \ responsible for your own investment decisions and transactions.\n\n3 Likes\n\n\
