title: Re-do of:Should the DAO perform the following treasury operations?
body: '# Executive Summary

  This proposal aims to execute some treasury operations, some aligned with governance
  (such as claiming and burning the vested GNO and the creation of the delegates.gnosis.eth
  subdomain) and others are regular operations of the GnosisDAO Safe.

  # Proposed Actions

  Claim Gelato (GEL) tokens

  Claim COW tokens from the VCOW token

  Approve and withdraw WETH from Aave as ETH

  Claim and burn 3.15m GNO from vesting contract (changed from 2.97m due to time passed)

  Transfer FRAX, COW, WBTC and stETH to the treasury

  Creation of subdomain delegates.gnosis.eth and subsequently transfer it to the treasury

  These actions will mainly occur from the GnosisDAO Safe. After the treasury gets
  the subdomain, karpatkey will move forward with the creation of the delegates.gnosis.eth
  Snapshot subspace, as agreed by the DAO in GIP 112.

  # Summary

  Simulation here (note: GNO and VCOW will vary due to claimable tokens increasing
  over time)

  Subdomain: delegates.gnosis.eth'
