title: Should the GnosisDAO onboard into Centrifuge Prime?
body: "Executive Summary\nThis proposal initiates the onboarding of GnosisDAO into\
  \ Centrifuge Prime by investing part of the treasury into Real-world assets (RWAs).\
  \ The onboarding will be contingent upon the establishment of a Legal Conduit for\
  \ GnosisDAO by Centrifuge for the safe investment of RWAs. This proposal will integrate\
  \ existing treasury management processes and services providers such as karpatkey\
  \ DAO. The benefit of this proposal will provide the GnosisDAO Treasury with an\
  \ additional diversified source of yield, a resilient legal infrastructure for engaging\
  \ with RWA investments, and access to additional diversified sources of credit through\
  \ Centrifuge.\n\nService Description\nThis proposal initiates the onboarding of\
  \ GnosisDAO into Centrifuge Prime to invest part of the treasury into RWAs. Centrifuge\
  \ will provide the services to establish a legal structure that supports safe RWA\
  \ investments, integrates GnosisDAO’s treasury management processes, establishes\
  \ any technical integrations needed, and facilitates the curation of a diversified\
  \ investment portfolio.\n\nOnce established, this proposal targets an initial allocation\
  \ of $10m USD into Centrifuge Prime, through pools such as Anemoy LTF, New Silver\
  \ 1, and other available pools.\n\nCentrifuge has been collaborating closely with\
  \ karpatkey DAO and GnosisDAO contributors on a variety of RWA initiatives within\
  \ the Gnosis ecosystem. Beyond bringing new exposure to the GnosisDAO treasury,\
  \ possible ideas include:\n\ndeploying Centrifuge Liquidity Pools directly on Gnosis\
  \ Chain;\nleveraging the Centrifuge Securitization Engine for the issuance of unique\
  \ pools for the Gnosis community; and\nexploring deeper partnerships with specific\
  \ parties and efforts inside the Gnosis ecosystem.\nWe view this proposal as the\
  \ first step in bringing the Gnosis and Centrifuge ecosystems more closely together\
  \ and establishing a flourishing partnership for Real World Assets in DeFi and Gnosis\
  \ Chain.\n\nKey aspects\nThis proposal will accomplish:\n\nEstablishing a Legal\
  \ Conduit for the safe investment of real-world assets.\nIntegrating the existing\
  \ treasury management process to utilize this conduit.\nFacilitating ongoing management\
  \ tasks including portfolio and asset curation, reporting via the Centrifuge Credit\
  \ Group, and dedicated technical and user support.\nThe Legal Conduit\n\nThe legal\
  \ structure will be integrated with DAO governance to ultimately be owned and operated\
  \ by GNOtoken holders. The principle idea behind the structure is to establish an\
  \ entity that is capable of signing and fulfilling legal agreements on behalf of\
  \ the DAO, ultimately enabling GnosisDAO’s path to legal recourse. This provides\
  \ a high degree of reliability and security for RWA investments, without compromising\
  \ the principles and position of the DAO.\n\n\n1600×936 178 KB\nThis framework is\
  \ based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar 1 structures.\
  \ There, the same structure supports a >$1B in deployed capital.\n\nWhile the legal\
  \ conduit is initially intended to facilitate an investment by GnosisDAO into RWA\
  \ offered through Centrifuge Prime, the same structure could potentially also be\
  \ used to diversify GnosisDAO’s treasury into RWAs available through other platforms/issuers/brokers,\
  \ thereby expanding the scope of treasury management activities currently available\
  \ to the DAO.\n\nIntegrated Management Process\n\nGnosisDAO has an existing sophisticated\
  \ and high-quality non custodial treasury management process, pioneered and led\
  \ by karpatkey DAO. The services in this proposal will be fully integrated to support\
  \ the existing processes efficiently, while also supporting any future developments\
  \ within the DAO. These processes and overall structure will be developed in collaboration\
  \ with the Gnosis community.\n\nOngoing Management and Support\n\nCentrifuge Prime\
  \ provides dedicated access to the Centrifuge ecosystem and community. As part of\
  \ this proposal, the Centrifuge team will work directly with karpatkey DAO to provide\
  \ ongoing support for the RWA portfolio allocated through Prime.\n\nThis will involve\
  \ ecosystem and pipeline management with dedicated relationships to high-quality\
  \ asset managers, service providers, and other actors necessary to maintain and\
  \ curate a diversified RWA portfolio. The Centrifuge Credit Group, a DAO entity\
  \ setup to provide risk and credit analysis, can be utilized to provide general-purpose\
  \ reporting for investors. This provides an additional level of ongoing monitoring\
  \ and independent analysis for karpatkey DAO and the community to utilize.\n\nFinally,\
  \ Centrifuge is committed to providing technical and user support to the Gnosis\
  \ community. This includes community education and engagement, support for technical\
  \ integrations, and dedicated support to the investment and portfolio management\
  \ team.\n\nBeyond US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the\
  \ Gnosis DAO to allocate into the following asset classes:\n\nBucket Focus\tDescription\t\
  Targeted Returns\tLiquidity Thresholds\nLiquidity\tLowest risk while maintaining\
  \ US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds\t5-6%\tDaily\nPreservation\tInvestments\
  \ in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc.\t6-8%\t3-6 months\n\
  Acceleration\tTrade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets\t8-20%\t3-24mo\n\
  Service Scope - Describe the scope of the service, including any limitations or\
  \ exclusions that apply.\nThe scope of services described above intends to cover\
  \ the RWA investments made through Centrifuge Prime.\n\nService delivery - Give\
  \ an overview of how the service will be delivered, including any key processes,\
  \ procedures, or technologies.\nThe process for establishing the legal conduit is\
  \ as follows:\n\nThe Centrifuge contributor team will retain external legal counsel\
  \ in the Cayman Islands to represent the Gnosis DAO’s interests. The results of\
  \ this work will be presented to the Gnosis DAO, and the community will have time\
  \ to process, provide feedback, and otherwise request changes in the legal structure.\
  \ The structure will only be implemented and executed with DAO approval, via the\
  \ requisite process as requested by the community.\n\nThe follow-on processes and\
  \ procedures will be developed over further collaboration with the community.\n\n\
  Support - Provide a brief description of the support services that are provided.\n\
  The support services are mentioned above.\n\nPricing and payment\nThe pricing for\
  \ this proposal is structured to streamline fees. The usage of GNO as a reward helps\
  \ to align incentives towards long-term interests versus short-term benefits.\n\n\
  The fee structure is as follows:\n\nFees\t\t\nStructural Setup\tup to 50,000 USDC\t\
  To be paid immediately into a Safe controlled by Centrifuge to pay for lawyers and\
  \ Cayman service providers to set up a Cayman foundation company to the benefit\
  \ of the Gnosis DAO, any unused budget will be returned to the GnosisDAO treasury.\
  \ The structure may require ongoing fees but will be assessed on a periodic basis\
  \ and only after approval from the DAO.\nPortfolio Fee\t0.35% p.a. on assets in\
  \ Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M\tAccrued on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge\
  \ for maintenance and support and payable upon redemption.\nGnosis Rewards\t250\
  \ GNO, paid incrementally over 12 months into the Centrifuge treasury, starting\
  \ with the first $1M Deployment into Centrifuge Prime. GNO would be locked for a\
  \ period of 12 months.\tTo cover costs of resource and facilitation time for the\
  \ development of the infrastructure and processes. Centrifuge DAO intends for this\
  \ to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.\n\
  Service Terms and Exit Strategy\nCentrifuge Prime can be unwound and offboarded\
  \ with 30 days’ notice. The positions and structures can be off-boarded entirely\
  \ or transferred to new ownership. Investments themselves will be subject to the\
  \ policies of the investment contract, but can also be unwound.\n\nTeam/Organization\n\
  Centrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWAs on as collateral.\
  \ Notable firsts include minting MakerDAO’s first real-world asset, structuring\
  \ the first on chain securitization, launching the RWA Market with Aave, and partnering\
  \ with BlockTower to bring the first credit fund operations on chain. Centrifuge\
  \ Prime is built for the needs of large decentralized organizations. It provides\
  \ the infrastructure and services to quickly and easily onboard and scale a fully\
  \ diversified portfolio of real-world assets. Through Centrifuge Prime, decentralized\
  \ organizations can get access to an institutional ecosystem of RWA partners and\
  \ service providers.\n\nCentrifuge is a DAO-governed protocol. K/Factory contributes\
  \ to the Centrifuge protocol by providing development, and infrastructure, and working\
  \ with users to ensure adoption.\n\nMore contributor information can be found on\
  \ the Centrifuge website 2.\n\nConclusion\nThis proposal represents a significant\
  \ step forward for the Gnosis community in its RWA engagement. Centrifuge Prime\
  \ is an optimal solution for developing a diversified RWA portfolio that the DAO\
  \ can integrate into its existing treasury management solutions. Centrifuge has\
  \ collaborated with karpatkey DAO on the development of this proposal and, with\
  \ support from the Gnosis Community, would like to continue this collaboration to\
  \ add additional exposure to the GnosisDAO treasury."
