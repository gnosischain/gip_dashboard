title: Should GnosisDAO distribute SAFE tokens to incentivize decentralizing Gnosis
  Chain?
body: 'As decided in GIP-29, GnosisDAO is receiving 15% of the total SAFE token supply
  over a period of 4 years. We suggest using the SAFE tokens to support the main objective
  of GnosisDAO: Making the Gnosis Chain successful. We want to position Gnosis Chain
  as the most decentralized network available. To support this objective, we suggest
  distributing the SAFE tokens as additional yield to those participating in staking
  on the Gnosis Beacon Chain.


  We suggest the following distribution:


  - Equal distribution of vested SAFE tokens to GNO holders on a monthly basis until
  the end of the locking period (February 15, 2023, about 0.9% of all SAFE tokens).

  - Eligible GNO:

  - GNO in locking contracts on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.

  - GNO used by individual stakers.

  - GNO/sGNO used in the curve pool GNO:sGNO 19

  - After the end of the locking period:

  Use up to 9.1% of the remaining SAFE tokens as additional yield for stakers on the
  Gnosis Beacon Chain over the remaining vesting period. The distribution should be
  based on the importance of the different staking categories:

  - individual stakers (e.g. dappnode users)

  - distributed liquid staking (e.g. rocket pool users)

  - professional staking services (e.g. chorus.one)

  liquid staking (e.g. stakewise, lido))'
