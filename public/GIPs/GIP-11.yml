title: Enable SafeSnap
body: '## Simple Summary

  This is a proposal to update the GnosisDAO''s governance structure in a way that
  keeps the benefits of off-chain voting while allowing for trustless and permissionless
  on-chain execution, using the recently released [DAO module and SafeSnap plugin](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f).


  ## Motivation

  The current governance structure is designed to be maximally inclusive: gas-free
  voting with delegation. This, however, comes at the cost of some additional trust
  in the system. Primarily, GnosisDAO must trust that the GnosisDAO Safe multi-sig
  will faithfully execute its will on-chain.


  In order to make the GnosisDAO more autonomous, we should more meaningfully give
  it control over its on-chain execution.


  ## Specification

  Gnosis Ltd recently developed the [DAO module](https://github.com/gnosis/dao-module)
  and [SafeSnap Snapshot Plugin](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot.js/tree/master/src/plugins/daoModule).


  In combination with the Gnosis Safe, this tool allows for:


  * Trustless and permissionless on-chain execution of arbitrary function calls

  * Continued use of our existing Snapshot strategies (ERC20 BalanceOf and Delegated
  ERC20 BalanceOf)

  * Cheap/free and low friction participation for Participants.


  ## Rationale

  As described in the [SafeSnap announcement post](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f),
  the path to progressive decentralization can be broken down into three steps.


  1. **Multi-sig as a proxy:**  Gnosis Safe + Snapshot, in which the multi-sig promises
  to act in accordance with the off-chain votes. This is the status quo.

  2. **Multi-sig as a safeguard:**  Gnosis Safe + Snapshot + SafeSnap, in which on-chain
  execution of off-chain votes is handled by the SafeSnap module, but there are still
  multi-sig owners that can veto malicious actions or act quickly in the case of an
  emergency.

  3. **Look ma, no hands!:**  Gnosis Safe + Snapshot + SafeSnap, in which the multi-sig
  owners have been removed, and the only way to execute transactions is via the SafeSnap
  module.


  This proposal is to move from (1) to (2) by deploying an instance of the DAO module,
  enabling it in the GnosisDAO Gnosis Safe, and updating the GnosisDAO Snapshot space
  to include the SafeSnap module.


  ## Implementation

  The DAO module should have the following parameters set:


  * **Oracle:**  GNO denominated instance of Reality.eth `0x8f1CC53bf34932591177CDA24723486205CA7510`

  * **Reality question timeout:**   `48 hours`

  * **Proposal cooldown:**   `48 hours`

  * **Proposal expiration:**   `7 days`

  * **Minimum bond:**   `10 GNO`

  * **Question Template:**  [see this document](http://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmP5ptVAmAcBLJB5bpZntADLieaWRc2iN2V8UQBRoQDA56)

  * **Arbitrator:** Reality.eth contract, so that it is not possible to call arbitration

  `0x8f1CC53bf34932591177CDA24723486205CA7510`



  **Transactions that need to be executed:**


  On the [`gnosis.eth` ENS name](https://app.ens.domains/name/gnosis.eth):

  * update  `snapshot`  text record to  `ipfs://QmPdrDbYVPCz6ASgYvvYWkdpDmZ7pph7TnT4K3zhq1dfP7`

  * update  `daorequirements`  text record to  `ipfs://QmP5ptVAmAcBLJB5bpZntADLieaWRc2iN2V8UQBRoQDA56`

  * set  `registrant`  and  `controller`  to  `0x0DA0C3e52C977Ed3cBc641fF02DD271c3ED55aFe`


  On the [deployed DaoModule](0x0eBaC21F7f6A6599B5fa5f57Baaa974ADFEC4613):

  * update  `questionArbitrator`  to  `0x8f1CC53bf34932591177CDA24723486205CA7510`

  * update  `minimumBond`  to  `10 GNO`

  * update  `questionCooldown`  to  `48 hours`


  On the [GnosisDAO''s safe](http://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x0DA0C3e52C977Ed3cBc641fF02DD271c3ED55aFe/transactions):

  * call  `enableModule("0x0eBaC21F7f6A6599B5fa5f57Baaa974ADFEC4613")`'
