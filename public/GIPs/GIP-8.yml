  \ \n    author: Anna George\n    status: Draft\n    type: Meta\n    created: 2021-03-10\n\
  \    \n\nThis is a continuation of the original post by @StefanGeorge, moving it\
  \ to phase 2 as the proposal was well perceived in the Forum discussion and the\
  \ technical requirements for implementation have been set up in the meantime.\n\n\
  **Tl;dr:**\n\nCurrently, the GnosisDAO Snapshot setup does not allow for LP token\
  \ voting. This forces GNO token holders to decide between liquidity provisioning\
  \ and governance participation.\n\nThis proposal suggests adding a LP token voting\
  \ strategy to the Gnosis Snapshot space. Please vote on a) whether you want one\
  \ / two / no strategy to be added to Snapshot, and b) which strategy/ies you would\
  \ like to have added.\n\n**The Proposal:**\n\nGNO locked up in liquidity pools can\
  \ currently not be used for voting on Gnosis Snapshot proposals. This creates a\
  \ tradeoff for GNO token holders: they can either earn yields OR participate in\
  \ governance decisions. This is concerning for two reasons:\n\n  1. Liquidity providers\
  \ – usually long term holders – are taking a risk to ensure the token remains liquid\
  \ on the market, enabling new community members to join by buying GNO without large\
  \ slippage. They are providing a service that helps the GNO community and should\
  \ not be punished with having no voting rights.\n  2. As briefly touched upon above,\
  \ it’s in the GnosisDAO’s interest to have large liquidity of GNO. Striving for\
  \ increased liquidity whilst not allowing for LP token voting poses a conflict of\
  \ interest:  \nThe more capital is “locked up” in liquidity pools without voting\
  \ being enabled, the less likely it is that GnosisDAO votes will meet the required\
  \ threshold for proposals to pass.\n\n\n\nAt present, a large amount of GNO is already\
  \ used for liquidity provisioning, demonstrating the relevance of this proposal:\n\
  \n  * 32M in Balancer\n  * 8M in Uniswap\n  * 0.7M in Sushiswap\n\n\n\nWhile the\
  \ Snapshot team developed strategies that enable LP token voting for all major AMMs,\
  \ the UI limits the amount of strategies that can be deployed to four. As the Gnosis\
  \ Space already has two strategies enabled (‘GNO balance’ and ‘Delegated GNO balance’),\
  \ only up to two LP token voting strategies could be added at this point. There\
  \ are some arguments in favour of only adding one new strategy for the time being\
  \ in order to keep at least one strategy open for future use cases.\n\nThe full\
  \ list of potential LP token voting strategies that are currently relevant to GNO\
  \ & enabled by Snapshot is added as answer options in the poll above. Please decide\
  \ on which - if any - strategy you would like to see enabled in the Gnosis Snapshot\
  \ space. To review the discussion that has evolved since December please check the\
  \ original post here.\n\n3 Likes\n\nShould GnosisDAO allow to use GNO locked in\
  \ balancer pools for voting in snapshot proposals?\n\nGIP-28: Allow GNO holders\
  \ to vote even if their GNO are invested/staked/locked in Smart Contracts in different\
  \ protocols/networks\n\nGIP-28: Allow GNO holders to vote even if their GNO are\
