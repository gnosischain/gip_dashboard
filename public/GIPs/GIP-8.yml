  \nThis is a continuation of the [original post](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-allow-to-use-gno-locked-in-balancer-pools-for-voting-in-snapshot-proposals/902)\
  \ by [@StefanGeorge](/u/stefangeorge), moving it to phase 2 as the proposal was\
  \ well perceived in the Forum discussion and the technical requirements for implementation\
  \ have been set up in the meantime.\n\n**Tl;dr:**\n\nCurrently, the GnosisDAO Snapshot\
  \ setup does not allow for LP token voting. This forces GNO token holders to decide\
  \ between liquidity provisioning and governance participation.\n\nThis proposal\
  \ suggests adding a LP token voting strategy to the Gnosis Snapshot space. Please\
  \ vote on a) whether you want one / two / no strategy to be added to Snapshot, and\
  \ b) which strategy/ies you would like to have added.\n\n**The Proposal:**\n\nGNO\
  \ locked up in liquidity pools can currently not be used for voting on Gnosis Snapshot\
  \ proposals. This creates a tradeoff for GNO token holders: they can either earn\
  \ yields OR participate in governance decisions. This is concerning for two reasons:\n\
  \n  1. Liquidity providers – usually long term holders – are taking a risk to ensure\
  \ the token remains liquid on the market, enabling new community members to join\
  \ by buying GNO without large slippage. They are providing a service that helps\
  \ the GNO community and should not be punished with having no voting rights.\n \
  \ 2. As briefly touched upon above, it’s in the GnosisDAO’s interest to have large\
  \ liquidity of GNO. Striving for increased liquidity whilst not allowing for LP\
  \ token voting poses a conflict of interest:  \nThe more capital is “locked up”\
  \ in liquidity pools without voting being enabled, the less likely it is that GnosisDAO\
  \ votes will meet the required threshold for proposals to pass.\n\n\n\nAt present,\
  \ a large amount of GNO is already used for liquidity provisioning, demonstrating\
  \ the relevance of this proposal:\n\n  * 32M in [Balancer](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/explore?token=0x6810e776880C02933D47DB1b9fc05908e5386b96)\n\
  \  * 8M in [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x3e8468f66d30fc99f745481d4b383f89861702c6)\n\
  \  * 0.7M in [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/pair/0x41328fdba556c8c969418ccccb077b7b8d932aa5)\n\
  \n\n\nWhile the Snapshot team developed [strategies](https://snapshot.page/#/strategies)\
  \ that enable LP token voting for all major AMMs, the UI limits the amount of strategies\
  \ that can be deployed to four. As the Gnosis Space already has two strategies enabled\
  \ (‘GNO balance’ and ‘Delegated GNO balance’), only up to two LP token voting strategies\
  \ could be added at this point. There are some arguments in favour of only adding\
  \ one new strategy for the time being in order to keep at least one strategy open\
  \ for future use cases.\n\nThe full list of potential LP token voting strategies\
  \ that are currently relevant to GNO & enabled by Snapshot is added as answer options\
  \ in the poll above. Please decide on which - if any - strategy you would like to\
  \ see enabled in the Gnosis Snapshot space. To review the discussion that has evolved\
  \ since December please check the original post [here](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-allow-to-use-gno-locked-in-balancer-pools-for-voting-in-snapshot-proposals/902).\n\
