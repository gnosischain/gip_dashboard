  \ voting on Snapshot \n    author: Anna George\n    status: Draft\n    type: Meta\n\
  \    created: 2021-03-10\n    \n\nThis is a continuation of the [original post](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-allow-to-use-gno-locked-in-balancer-pools-for-voting-in-snapshot-proposals/902)\
  \ by [@StefanGeorge](/u/stefangeorge), moving it to phase 2 as the proposal was\
  \ well perceived in the Forum discussion and the technical requirements for implementation\
  \ have been set up in the meantime.\n\n**Tl;dr:**\n\nCurrently, the GnosisDAO Snapshot\
  \ setup does not allow for LP token voting. This forces GNO token holders to decide\
  \ between liquidity provisioning and governance participation.\n\nThis proposal\
  \ suggests adding a LP token voting strategy to the Gnosis Snapshot space. Please\
  \ vote on a) whether you want one / two / no strategy to be added to Snapshot, and\
  \ b) which strategy/ies you would like to have added.\n\n**The Proposal:**\n\nGNO\
  \ locked up in liquidity pools can currently not be used for voting on Gnosis Snapshot\
  \ proposals. This creates a tradeoff for GNO token holders: they can either earn\
  \ yields OR participate in governance decisions. This is concerning for two reasons:\n\
  \n  1. Liquidity providers – usually long term holders – are taking a risk to ensure\
  \ the token remains liquid on the market, enabling new community members to join\
  \ by buying GNO without large slippage. They are providing a service that helps\
  \ the GNO community and should not be punished with having no voting rights.\n \
  \ 2. As briefly touched upon above, it’s in the GnosisDAO’s interest to have large\
  \ liquidity of GNO. Striving for increased liquidity whilst not allowing for LP\
  \ token voting poses a conflict of interest:  \nThe more capital is “locked up”\
  \ in liquidity pools without voting being enabled, the less likely it is that GnosisDAO\
  \ votes will meet the required threshold for proposals to pass.\n\n\n\nAt present,\
  \ a large amount of GNO is already used for liquidity provisioning, demonstrating\
  \ the relevance of this proposal:\n\n  * 32M in [Balancer](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/explore?token=0x6810e776880C02933D47DB1b9fc05908e5386b96)\n\
  \  * 8M in [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x3e8468f66d30fc99f745481d4b383f89861702c6)\n\
  \  * 0.7M in [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/pair/0x41328fdba556c8c969418ccccb077b7b8d932aa5)\n\
  \n\n\nWhile the Snapshot team developed [strategies](https://snapshot.page/#/strategies)\
  \ that enable LP token voting for all major AMMs, the UI limits the amount of strategies\
  \ that can be deployed to four. As the Gnosis Space already has two strategies enabled\
  \ (‘GNO balance’ and ‘Delegated GNO balance’), only up to two LP token voting strategies\
  \ could be added at this point. There are some arguments in favour of only adding\
  \ one new strategy for the time being in order to keep at least one strategy open\
  \ for future use cases.\n\nThe full list of potential LP token voting strategies\
  \ that are currently relevant to GNO & enabled by Snapshot is added as answer options\
  \ in the poll above. Please decide on which - if any - strategy you would like to\
  \ see enabled in the Gnosis Snapshot space. To review the discussion that has evolved\
  \ since December please check the original post [here](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-allow-to-use-gno-locked-in-balancer-pools-for-voting-in-snapshot-proposals/902).\n\

  \n[Rafa](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Rafa) March 10, 2021, 1:40pm  2\n\nThanks for\
  \ setting this up. I think at some point, all LPs should be able to vote.\n\nLPs\
  \ already take the risk of IL and inventory risk by providing liquidity. In general,\
  \ liquidity is always a positive thing for tokens, given that it makes them more\
  \ accesible to new adopters, determines price more efficiently, and reduces volatility\
  \ related to low liquidity. I think LPs do enough already for the both GNO token\
  \ and the GnosisDAO and should be offered a voice in the decision making process.\n\

  \ tschubotz:\n\n> Is this a technical restriction or is there another reason for\

  \ that the results are computed on the users’ browsers - having too many strategies\
  \ would take too long for results to resolve because it requires sending more requests.\n\

  \ 16, 2021, 5:22pm  8\n\nIdeally I would like to keep several options open when\
  \ moving this proposal to Snapshot, as the vote here only received 19 participants\
  \ so far and the result of a token-weighted voting could be different to this forum\
  \ vote.  \nThe options I ideally would like to include:\n\n  * Make no change\n\
  \  * Add Balancer and Uniswap LP Voting Strategies\n  * Add Balancer and Sushiswap\
  \ LP Voting Strategies\n  * Add Balancer LP Voting Strategy\n\n\n\nHowever, I am\
  \ concerned that giving too many answer options will cause the vote to fail as the\
  \ threshold won’t be reached. (The threshold is 4% of total GNO circulating supply\
  \ voted on the WINNING result).  \nHence, my suggestion is to only vote on two options:\n\
  \n  * Make no change\n  * Add Balancer and Uniswap LP Voting Strategies\n\n\n\n\
  Any thoughts on this?\n\n[gnostik](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/gnostik) March 16,\
  \ 2021, 8:29pm  9\n\nI might be wrong, but my impression is that a single custom\
  \ strategy can be developed to aggregate voting power from multiple sources, e.g.\
  \ by querying multiple subgraphs. The concern of having to wait for all requests\
  \ to complete is still valid, though proper use of `await` should help with that.\n\

  \ gnostik:\n\n> single custom strategy can be developed to aggregate voting power\
  \ from multiple sources\n\nThis should be possible, but it would require that someone\
  \ develops this strategy. The mentioned options would reuse existing strategies.\
  \ But maybe this option should be added to the voting ![:thinking:](https://forum.gnosis.io/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=12)\n\

  \nI would only add strategies to the voting that exist already / we know they will\

  \ I briefly spoke to Fabien from snapshot and relayed your idea to him but they\
  \ don’t have it on their roadmap for now. If we wanted to move ahead with that we\
  \ would need a GnosisDAO vote to fund the development of this feature and set up\
  \ a bounty.  \nI would recommend for now to vote on implementing one/two already\
  \ existing strategies and actually see how much they are being used. Then we can\
  \ pick up the discussion when we see LP token voting is highly being leveraged.\
  \ Anyways, there are currently only 3 protocols for which GNO LP token voting would\
  \ be relevant, two of them we can already accommodate.\n\n1 Like\n\n[Creampp](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Creampp)\

  \ March 24, 2021, 12:44pm  16\n\nBefore this goes live in Phase 3, I wanted to share\
  \ [this voting power contract](https://github.com/banteg/guest-list/pull/10) that\
  \ Banteg from Yearn put together.  \nEssentially, it creates a getter function that\
  \ returns a “voting power” number, your governance token balance across a variety\
  \ of pools.  \nThis way, we could track more than two additional pools without overloading\
  \ the Snapshot UI.\n\nI think it’s worth exploring a version of this as an option\
  \ before proceeding to phase 3.\n\n3 Likes\n\n[clesaege](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/clesaege)\
  \ April 27, 2021, 5:13pm  17\n\nI think it’s best to allow as much GNO as possible\

  \nYes, 100%, this would be the best solution in my view. The only open question\
  \ is about resource allocation to implement it. Will touch base on this with some\
  \ devs this week. If it’s feasible, then we can simply have a vote on “Let’s implement\
  \ the voting power contract to enable LP token voting” “make no change”.\n\n2 Likes\n\
