title: 'Should GnosisDAO support an annual renewal for Blockscout SLA and hosting:
  January 2026 - December 2026'
body: "# Executive Summary\nBlockscout proposes a one-year renewal of its SLA and\
  \ hosting services for Gnosis to provide the ecosystem’s open-source block explorer\
  \ and developer infrastructure. Over the past year explorer usage has continued\
  \ to grow, with Gnosis Monthly Active Users averages increasing 94% year-over-year\
  \ (from 28.9K in 2024 to 56.2K in 2025) and Gnosis Daily active users nearly doubling\
  \ from 1,059 to 1,992. Page views averaged 110K monthly since May 2025 (excluding\
  \ July which had a large spike) demonstrating the explorer’s critical role in the\
  \ Gnosis ecosystem.\n\nWe’ve also seen several short term spikes in usage, denoting\
  \ times when either other ecosystem explorers were unavailable or application launches\
  \ on Gnosis including Metri and Circles saw a large influx of users. The ability\
  \ to handle these usage spikes is crucial for ecosystem viability.\n\nGnosis requires\
  \ reliable blockchain infrastructure that supports developers, validators, and users\
  \ on the chain. A dedicated open-source and customizable explorer provides needed\
  \ redundancy, transaction transparency, contract verification tools (with much more\
  \ traction than Gnosisscan), and user onboarding features.\n\n# Ecosystem Benefits\
  \ and Traction: \n\nBlockscout’s continued support enables:\n\n- Accessibility for\
  \ all network participants\n- 13,500+ verified MyAccount users on the explorer\n\
  - Superior contract verification rates (185,601 verified contracts vs. Gnosisscan’s\
  \ 15,044) due to our multichain ETH bytecode DB\n- Advanced tooling availability\
  \ for developers, including TheGraph integration and essential DApps inclusion in\
  \ the Dapp marketplace\n- Improved user onboarding through name services, DEX tracking,\
  \ and our upcoming bridge indexing initiative\n- Infrastructure that supports the\
  \ Gnosis vision for decentralized, low-risk and user-friendly blockchain applications\n\
  - Joint work with Circles team to onboard users and promote Circles to our large,\
  \ multi-chain audience\n\n# Universal Bridge Indexer\n\nWe are continuing to work\
  \ on our Universal Bridge Indexer and plan to deliver this feature to the Gnosis\
  \ explorer in 2026. We will investigate the current and future updates coming to\
  \ the Gnosis bridge to maintain compatibility. The service will support the Gnosis\
  \ bridge, focusing on cross-chain token transfers and messages. The indexer will\
  \ be developed as a standalone service which is tightly integrated into the Blockscout\
  \ UI and associated API endpoints.\n\n# Service Description\nBlockscout provides\
  \ comprehensive block explorer and infrastructure services for Gnosis mainnet and\
  \ Chiado testnet, serving as the ecosystem’s primary interface for blockchain data,\
  \ contract interaction, and network analytics.\n\n**Key Aspects**\n- Enterprise-Grade\
  \ Infrastructure: 99.9% uptime with redundant hosting architecture\n- Advanced Contract\
  \ Verification: Industry-leading verification tooling supporting Solidity, Vyper,\
  \ and multi-part verification\n- Integrated DApp Ecosystem: Essential tools including\
  \ Multisend, Dapp Marketplace, and DEX tracker\n- Developer-Focused Features: Comprehensive\
  \ API access, and real-time data feeds\n- User Experience Innovations: Name service\
  \ integration (.GNO and .ETH names), Blockscout DeFi, Gas.zip integration, and intuitive\
  \ UI/UX\n\n**Service Scope**\n- Mainnet explorer hosting and maintenance (gnosis.blockscout.com\
  \ 1)\n- Real-time and historical indexing for transactions, blocks, tokens, and\
  \ smart contracts\n- Chiado testnet explorer hosting and maintenance\n- 24/7 monitoring\
  \ and incident response\n- Regular feature updates and security patches\n- API infrastructure\
  \ with rate-limited public access\n- Contract verification and interaction\n- Integration\
  \ support for ecosystem projects\n\n**Service Delivery**\nBlockscout delivers services\
  \ through a multi-layered architecture:\n- Infrastructure Layer: Hosting services\
  \ with load balancing and automatic failover\n- Indexing Layer: Real-time blockchain\
  \ data processing with sub-second latency\n- Application Layer: User-facing explorer\
  \ with responsive design and mobile optimization\n- API Layer: JSON RPC & RESTful\
  \ endpoints with comprehensive documentation\n- Support Layer: Technical support\
  \ via dedicated channels and community forums\n\n**Support**\n- Technical Support:\
  \ Direct communication channel for ecosystem partners and core developers\n- Incident\
  \ Response: 24/7 monitoring with fast response time for critical issues\n- Community\
  \ Support: Public documentation, FAQ resources, and community forum monitoring\n\
  - Integration Assistance: Technical consultation for projects integrating with Blockscout\
  \ on Gnosis\n- Reporting: Monthly analytics reports and quarterly business reviews\
  \ with GnosisDAO stakeholders\n\n# Pricing and Payment\nWe propose a renewal of\
  \ our 12-month engagement to begin on January 1, 2026 and continuing through December\
  \ 31, 2026. This results in 2 free months of service from the previous engagement\
  \ and extends our agreement to start at the beginning of the calendar year.\n\n\
  Although our DB storage has increased significantly on the Gnosis instance we are\
  \ able to maintain the same pricing model from last year due to storage and infra\
  \ optimizations.\n\nPricing Structure:\n\n- Gnosis Mainnet explorer and archive\
  \ node: $6,400 for hosting, services and maintenance for a total 12 month cost of\
  \ $76,800\n- Chiado Testnet explorer and archive node: $3,200/month for hosting,\
  \ services and maintenance for a total 12 month cost of $38,400\n**- All-in annual\
  \ cost: $115,200**\n\nAmount is requested up front for the year. Payment can be\
  \ made to Blockscout’s SAFE 0xAddress on Ethereum mainnet (0x242ba6d68FfEb4a098B591B32d370F973FF882B7)\
  \ with USDC or USDT and is requested by December 31, 2025. (if the proposal is not\
  \ resolved by Dec 31 we can be flexible regarding payment timing).\n\n# Service\
  \ Terms\nContract Duration: January 1, 2026 - December 31, 2026 (12 months). If\
  \ the DAO process takes longer than this to resolve we will maintain the service\
  \ until there is a clear outcome.\n\nRenewal Terms: This agreement may be renewed\
  \ for subsequent annual periods via the governance procews, with pricing subject\
  \ to review based on usage growth and market conditions.\n\n# Termination Conditions:\n\
  \nGnosisDAO may terminate this agreement under the following circumstances:\n\n\
  - Non-Performance or Cause: If Blockscout fails to maintain 99.9% uptime over any\
  \ 90-day period (excluding scheduled maintenance)\n- Convenience: Termination with\
  \ 90 days’ written notice\nIf service is terminated, the pro-rated amount will be\
  \ returned to the GnosisDAO within 1 month of termination completion.\n\n# Team/Organization\n\
  Blockscout recently welcomed Eva Zhang, the former Alipay UK CEO, as our new CEO\
  \ 1. Our founder Igor Barinov is currently working with the EF leading their privacy\
  \ initiative and continues to serve Blockscout in a consulting capacity. Many of\
  \ the Blockscout team members are former xDai developers who remain committed to\
  \ the long term growth and success of Gnosis.\n\n# Conclusion\nBlockscout’s partnership\
  \ with GnosisDAO has demonstrated substantial value, evidenced by our consistent\
  \ adoption and ecosystem engagement. We are committed to continuous innovation and\
  \ support services for Gnosis.The renewal of this SLA ensures a full-featured Gnosis\
  \ explorer continues to provide needed open-source tooling and onchain transparency.\n\
  \nWe look forward to continuing our partnership with GnosisDAO and supporting the\
  \ Gnosis mandate to provide accessible, decentralized blockchain infrastructure\
  \ to everyone."
