title: Safe{Boost} on Gnosis Chain
body: '## Executive Summary

  Safe{Boost} is a 6-month rewards program to expand Safe activity and users on Gnosis
  Chain where users earn points when performing certain activities. A total of 250k
  SAFE tokens will be distributed as part of the program, based on the points accrued.


  **As the Joint Treasury will fund the program, no additional funding is required
  for this initiative.**


  If the proposal receives support from both Gnosis DAO and Safe DAO, karpatkey will
  operationalise the program described below on behalf of the JT.


  ## Rationale

  As the treasury manager for the Safe DAO <> Gnosis DAO joint treasury (JT), karpatkey
  is responsible for allocating funds to initiatives to expand the Safe and Gnosis
  ecosystems. Within that scope, we propose launching a rewards program on Gnosis
  Chain, mirroring the activity included in the current [Safe{Pass}](https://safe.global/pass)
  program on Ethereum Mainnet. The goal is to boost Safe user onchain interactions
  on the Gnosis Chain and grow the number of SAFE token holders on the Gnosis Chain.


  This campaign will also serve as valuable experience in assessing the impact of
  incentives on the overall Safe activity in Gnosis Chain. Insights gained will help
  refine future initiatives, allowing for continuous improvement and increased efficiency
  based on real data.


  Out of the more than [280,000 Safe accounts created in Gnosis Chain](https://dune.com/karpatkey/safe-gno)
  since the beginning of 2024 to the end of Q3:

  - Around 10,000 Safes have had at least one week with more than 1 USD in TVL

  - Around 18,000 Safes have made at least one transaction

  - Around 6,000 Safes have transferred at least 1 USD in value


  ## Specification

  Safe{Boost} is a 6-month rewards program to expand Safe activity and users on Gnosis
  Chain. Users who perform the activities listed under the behavior section in Gnosis
  Chain (subject to eligibility terms) will earn points. Points will be updated weekly
  and made public in a Dune Analytics dashboard.


  The program will be administered by karpatkey, the manager of the JT, who will be
  responsible for tracking, determining, distributing the rewards, and reporting the
  results.


  #### Eligible Activities

  Safe users who conduct the following actions in Gnosis Chain will be rewarded with
  points:


  **Transaction count:** The number of transactions made with your Safe Account.

  **Transaction volume:** Volume of the transactions made with your Safe Account (accounts
  with at least 1 USD in volume are eligible for points).

  **Assets stored:** The total value of assets stored in your Safe Account (accounts
  with at least 1 USD in TVL are eligible for points).

  **Regular user:** Make at least one weekly transaction with your Safe Account.

  Specific actions related to program partners will also earn additional points. Each
  activity related to a program partner will be specific, have separate rewards, and
  might also qualify for points. karpatkey will reach out to protocols on the Gnosis
  Chain that are relevant to the ecosystem and also present a synergistic opportunity
  to onboard them to the program.


  #### Duration

  The program will last for six months. Pending DAO approval, it is expected to start
  on January 10th, 2025, and finish on July 9th, 2025.


  ## Budget

  Once the program ends, a total of 250k SAFE tokens will be distributed based on
  the points accrued throughout the duration. These SAFE rewards will be distributed
  by a stream funded from the JT on Gnosis Chain (or a specifically designated Safe
  with the JT wallet on Gnosis Chain as an owner) to all eligible Safes, with a stream
  duration of 3 months.


  As the Joint Treasury will fund the program, no additional funding is required for
  this initiative.
