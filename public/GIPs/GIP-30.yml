title: Should GnosisDAO reward 2300 GNO to Prysmatic Labs?
body: "##  Summary\n\nShould GnosisDAO reward 2300 GNO to Prysmatic Labs?\n\nSince\
  \ the launch of the Gnosis Beacon Chain over 60000 validators were launched. Those\
  \ validators almost exclusively run either Prysm or Lighthouse clients.\n\nGiven\
  \ the importance of Prysm for Gnosis Chain, we suggest rewarding the Prysmatic Labs\
  \ team with 2300 GNO for their work aligning incentives with their team.\n\nIn return\
  \ the Prysmatic Labs team will support Gnosis Chain in the following ways:\n\n \
  \ * A direct communication channel with the Gnosis Chain Team.\n  * Acceptance and\
  \ maintenance of minor changes to Prysm codebase to support Gnosis Chain.\n  * Acknowledgment\
  \ and timely review of any performance, regression, or general reports from Gnosis\
  \ regarding Prysm software.\n  * General feedback on gnosis chain and tooling.\n\
