  \ Labs?\n    author: GnosisDAO, Stefan George\n    status: Draft\n    type: Funding\n\
  \    created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (2022-03-10) format>\n    \n\n##  Summary\n\
  \nShould GnosisDAO reward 2300 GNO to Prysmatic Labs?\n\nSince the launch of the\
  \ Gnosis Beacon Chain over 60000 validators were launched. Those validators almost\
  \ exclusively run either Prysm or Lighthouse clients.\n\nGiven the importance of\
  \ Prysm for Gnosis Chain, we suggest rewarding the Prysmatic Labs team with 2300\
  \ GNO for their work aligning incentives with their team.\n\nIn return the Prysmatic\
  \ Labs team will support Gnosis Chain in the following ways:\n\n  * A direct communication\
  \ channel with the Gnosis Chain Team.\n  * Acceptance and maintenance of minor changes\
  \ to Prysm codebase to support Gnosis Chain.\n  * Acknowledgment and timely review\
  \ of any performance, regression, or general reports from Gnosis regarding Prysm\
  \ software.\n  * General feedback on gnosis chain and tooling.\n\n\n\n5 Likes\n\n\
