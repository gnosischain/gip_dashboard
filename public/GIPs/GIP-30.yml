  \nShould GnosisDAO reward 2300 GNO to Prysmatic Labs?\n\nSince the launch of the\
  \ [Gnosis Beacon Chain](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) over 60000 validators were\
  \ launched. Those validators almost exclusively run either Prysm or Lighthouse clients.\n\
  \nGiven the importance of Prysm for Gnosis Chain, we suggest rewarding the Prysmatic\
  \ Labs team with 2300 GNO for their work aligning incentives with their team.\n\n\
  In return the Prysmatic Labs team will support Gnosis Chain in the following ways:\n\
  \n  * A direct communication channel with the Gnosis Chain Team.\n  * Acceptance\
  \ and maintenance of minor changes to Prysm codebase to support Gnosis Chain.\n\
  \  * Acknowledgment and timely review of any performance, regression, or general\
  \ reports from Gnosis regarding Prysm software.\n  * General feedback on gnosis\
  \ chain and tooling.\n\n\n\n5 Likes\n\n[boonjue.eth](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/boonjue.eth)\
  \ March 11, 2022, 10:41pm  2\n\nI support this proposal.\n\nAs [@StefanGeorge](/u/stefangeorge)\
  \ mentioned, giving 2300 GNO (currently $690,000) to the Prysm team will help align\
  \ their incentives with those of Gnosis. In addition to GBC validators running almost\
  \ exclusively on Prysm, the most commonly used client on the ETH consensus layer\
  \ is Prysm (currently around 66%). As such, Prysm having a vested interest in the\
  \ well-being of Gnosis seems like a good move.\n\nIIRC, the GnosisDAO treasury currently\
  \ holds +150K ETH. Therefore, the success of Gnosis heavily depends on the success\
  \ of Ethereum. Similarly, because so many ETH validators rely on Prysm (almost exclusively\
  \ with GBC validators), the success of ETH - and therefore GNO - is at least partly\
  \ tied to the success of Prysm. Gnosis should nurture a mutually beneficial relationship\
  \ with the Prysm team as it would benefit all stakeholders in the Gnosis ecosystem.\
  \ Also, the shared cultural values between and among ETH, Prysm, and GNO align well\
  \ (at least, that is my sense of it).\n\nI think this is win-win all around.\n\n\

  \ of erigon more in line with eachother so we can set clear goals for client teams\
  \ that help Gnosis chain (and maybe proactively go to the other teams)\n\n2 Likes\n\
