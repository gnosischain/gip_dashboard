title: Should Gnosis DAO extend the Gnosis Pay Cashback budget (GIP-110) by 2,000
  GNO?
body: '**Summary**

  This proposal seeks to allocate 2,000 GNO to extend the existing Gnosis Pay Cashback
  Program as defined in [GIP-110](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-110-should-the-gnosis-dao-create-and-fund-a-gnosis-pay-rewards-program-with-10k-gno/8837).
  No changes suggested in [GIP-131](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-131-should-gnosis-dao-continue-and-update-the-gnosis-pay-cashback-programme/10377)
  or any other updates will be applied at this stage. All rules, tiers, limits, and
  conditions remain exactly as in GIP-110.


  **Rationale**

  The cashback program launched under GIP-110 has proven to be an effective user acquisition
  and engagement mechanism for Gnosis Pay. However, the allocated reward pool has
  been depleted.


  While GIP-131 is under active discussion, reaching consensus on a new model will
  take more time. To ensure continuity for users and avoid interruption of the program,
  we propose a bridge allocation of 2,000 GNO. This temporary extension gives the
  DAO and community the time needed to refine and agree on a more sustainable long-term
  model.


  **Implementation**


  The additional 2,000 GNO will be added to the existing cashback pool.

  All conditions (tiers, cashback percentages, spending caps, exclusions, distribution
  rules, etc.) will remain exactly the same as in GIP-110.

  The program will continue until the new funds are exhausted or until a new GIP replaces
  it.


  **Next Steps**


  If passed, funds will be allocated immediately to avoid program disruption.

  A separate proposal (building on GIP-131) will be brought forward once consensus
  on a revised model is reached.


  **Vote**


  YES: Allocate 2,000 GNO to extend Gnosis Pay Cashback Program under the rules of
  GIP-110.

  NO: Do not extend the program; cashback ends when the current pool is depleted.'
