title: 'GIP-120(revised): Should GnosisDAO acquire Headquarters (HQ.xyz) to Accelerate
  Gnosis 3.0'
body: "This is a revised proposal for [GIP-120](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-120-should-gnosisdao-acquire-headquarters-hq-xyz-to-accelerate-gnosis-3-0/9505).\
  \ The revision is about the purchase price and asks from GnosisDAO. \n\n# TLDR:\
  \ \nInvestors, founders, the team, and advisors get above 30% less in GNO. Investors\
  \ get the option to cash out at 40% discount. Founders get 1/3 upfront, 2/3 vested\
  \ over 4 years. The total amount paid by GnosisDAO for the acquisition is between\
  \ $7M and $8.95M depending on the options investors pick.\n\n# Reason for full acquisition\
  \ of Headquarters\nGnosis can promote Gnosis HQ as a Safe interface for Business.\n\
  Gnosis can establish a presence in Asia (relevant for Regulator- & Investor relations).\n\
  Gnosis Pay can leverage Gnosis HQ for the Corporate Card offering.\nHaving a Business\
  \ Account use case and presence in Asia is vital for the fruition of Gnosis 3.0.\
  \ Acquiring Headquarters will accelerate Gnosisâ€™ progress in the payments field\
  \ and allow it to have a strong global footprint.\n\nThe decision to fully acquire\
  \ instead of partial acquisition or investment is intentional - because it is through\
  \ a full acquisition of Headquarters and conversion of equity to tokens, that we\
  \ ensure full alignment to accruing value to the GNO token. This avoids the risk\
  \ of diluting interest across parties.\n\nEdit on 2025-01-10: Investor vesting for\
  \ GNO and SAFE was increased to 3 years total and cash discount was increased to\
  \ 40%.\n\nPlease refer to GIP-20 on the Gnosis Forum for complete details of the\
  \ proposal."
