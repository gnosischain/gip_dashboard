title: Should Gnosis pilot a DAOcast?
body: "# [Gnosis DAOcast](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR2xKzpdKsLaua3ShSSERnAu3a9xqd19oAsl-mGUrn5vDUFah0LNx9kjpeAtaKOZTj0D60Bj-uI8Z2E/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000)\n\
  ## Proposal Summary\nPilot a weekly live broadcast to communicate the latest developments\
  \ in the Gnosis DAO ecosystem, and provide a new way to grow the community through\
  \ education and fun.  \n\n## Background & Motivation\nAll public-facing DAO activities\
  \ and decisions (community calls, AMAâ€™s, forum discussions, snapshot votes, etc.)\
  \ can be harnessed to generate content that amplifies the work of the community,\
  \ and establish a unique narrative. Gnosis DAO is a dynamic project with respected\
  \ status in the industry; a live broadcast designed to cover its activities would\
  \ serve as a marketing resource, increase community engagement, and add a new layer\
  \ of communications transparency.\n\n## Specification \n\nDAOcast Format\n\n* **Episode\
  \ length**: ~1 hour\n\n* **Frequency**: Bi-weekly\n\n* **Pilot Duration:** 16 weeks\
  \ (8 total episodes)\n\n* **Logistics**: Show hosted on Twitter Spaces + audio combined\
  \ with visual overlays via OBS to be run live on YouTube. This format can enable\
  \ Gnosis DAO to grow its audience on two of the most important social media platforms\
  \ in the industry simultaneously. \n\n* **Content options:**  We have a variety\
  \ of content ideas for the pilot; there is a lot of room for creativity and we are\
  \ open to suggestions. After feedback from the Gnosis team, we will focus primarily\
  \ on content that helps to highlight the Gnosis Chain ecosystem, while also helping\
  \ to communicate wider developments in the DAO. \n\n* **Post-Show Highlights:**\
  \ Following each program, we will cut at least two (2) highlights from the broadcast.\
  \ At least one (1) of these cuts will be 2m 20s or under for use as twitter native\
  \ video; both cuts will be posted independently on YouTube to create a consistent\
  \ posting cadence required to gain traction with the algorithm.\n\n* **Aesthetic\
  \ Design:** All visuals used on YouTube will be aligned with the branding expectations\
  \ of Gnosis DAO.\n\n## How will we measure success?\nIn order to achieve success,\
  \ alignment with existing Gnosis DAO marketing / communications goals is required.\
  \ Should this initiative take flight, we hope to work closely with relevant teams\
  \ to ensure we are rowing in the same direction. We propose three KPI categories\
  \ for evaluating the pilot ([view table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uqSBzjHZon8GMZdGUOpqIePNlrsGp8G4VWPHsFghrQA/edit?usp=sharing)),\
  \ and will log data after each show. \n\n\n\n## Why our team?\n\nWe have excellent\
  \ knowledge of the web3 space, context on Gnosis DAO, and the logistical and technical\
  \ expertise required to research, plan, and execute consistent content creation.\

  \ + ~7.5 GNO (at current market price)\n**Recipient Address::** 0x9638530aA558c81253625d42f3018BC1544D9Dd3\n\
  **Network:** Gnosis Chain\n**Requested Payment Date:** Monthly payment is preferred\
  \ (4 month pilot).\n\n## Conclusion\nWe've had a great experience working with members\
  \ of the Gnosis Chain team, and are enthusiastic about contributing to the larger\
  \ DAO through this new media initiative. Your vote and feedback are greatly appreciated!\n"
