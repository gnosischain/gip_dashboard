title: Should TrustSwap deploy smart contract utilities on Gnosis Chain?
body: "https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-50-should-trustswap-deploy-smart-contract-utilities-on-gnosis-chain/5282?u=trustswap\n\
  \n[TrustSwap](https://trustswap.com/) is requesting a grant of $50,000 from the\
  \ Gnosis Ecosystem Fund to deploy a full suite of secure smart contract services\
  \ to the Gnosis blockchain.\n\nThis will include:\n\nToken Locks: Our token lock\
  \ platform currently has over $6B TVL across several major blockchains. These secure\
  \ time-locked contracts allow teams to lock up their tokens over a preset period\
  \ of time in a trustless way. This includes Liquidity Pair (LP) tokens and NFTs\
  \ as well.\n\nToken Mint: Anyone can easily generate a new token contract that is\
  \ fully audited and customizable without needing to write any code or hire expensive\
  \ developers. Mint makes it easy to tokenize any project, business, or community.\n\
  \nVesting: The TrustSwap Vesting portal provides a simple and secure way for projects\
  \ to distribute their tokens over time to their team and community. The tokens are\
  \ released in regular increments and users can claim their available tokens whenever\
  \ they want.\n\nBy using TrustSwap services, crypto projects can easily create,\
  \ secure, and launch their new tokens across multiple blockchains currently including\
  \ Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and more. We would like to\
  \ add Gnosis to this list and appreciate the support of the GnosisDAO community.\
  \ \n\nIf you have any questions, please email info@trustswap.org. Thank you."
