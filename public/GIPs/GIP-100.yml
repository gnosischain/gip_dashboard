  \    duration:<6 months>\n    funding:<$30 million>\n    \n\n#### Category\n\nTreasury\n\
  \n#### TL;DR\n\nI represent [Thanefield Capital](https://thanefield.capital/), a\
  \ multi-strategy crypto fund; GNO is one of our thesis-driven investments.\n\nCurrently,\
  \ GNO is significantly undervalued relative to its book value. To address this,\
  \ we propose initiating a large-scale buyback program. Our plan involves deploying\
  \ $30 million, representing about 5% of the estimated assets of Gnosis DAO, over\
  \ a six-month period.\n\n#### Introduction\n\nGnosis DAO has consistently been at\
  \ the forefront of innovation, successfully developing and launching products such\
  \ as Safe and CoW Protocol. These initiatives began as internal projects and were\
  \ later spun off into independent ventures. Despite these successes and several\
  \ previous rounds of buybacks, the GNO token has not adequately reflected the value\
  \ generated by these and numerous other activities.\n\nGNO is currently trading\
  \ below its book value, considering only the marketable tokens owned by Gnosis DAO.\
  \ This valuation suggests that the market is assigning a negative value to all other\
  \ Gnosis DAO assets. These assets include, but are not limited to, Gnosis Chain,\
  \ Gnosis Pay, Gnosis Wallet, Circles, a venture capital portfolio of over 40 companies,\
  \ and investments in four crypto VCs. This means that long-term GNO holders have\
  \ not financially benefited from the DAO’s successes in product development, venture\
  \ investments, and treasury management. Additionally, it becomes uneconomic to allocate\
  \ any GNO that already belong to the DAO for ecosystem growth or other initiatives,\
  \ as it would result in a negative value transfer for the DAO.\n\nGnosis DAO is\
  \ well-positioned to address this undervaluation as one of the most capitalized\
  \ DAOs, holding over $630 million in assets and ranking second only to Mantle in\
  \ terms of non-native marketable tokens. We propose initiating a substantial buyback\
  \ program to correct this disparity. If approved by a DAO vote, [@Karpatkey](/u/karpatkey)\
  \ will manage the execution of this program.\n\nIt’s important to note that this\
  \ proposal operates independently but complements the vision outlined in [Gnosis\
  \ DAO v3](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/introducing-gnosis-3-0/8252), which aims to\
  \ establish protocol-owned liquidity between GNO and portfolio projects. If approved\
  \ by the DAO, these initiatives should progress concurrently.\n\n#### Objectives\
  \ of the program\n\n  1. Transfer value from sellers to long-term holders by acquiring\
  \ GNO below its intrinsic value. The acquired tokens could then be utilized for\
  \ treasury swaps, incentives, growth initiatives, and further investments.\n  2.\
  \ Signal to the market a commitment to establishing a valuation floor for GNO that\
  \ consistently exceeds its book value.\n  3. Drive attention to the products of\
  \ the DAO. Given the attention-driven nature of the crypto market, where price often\
  \ influences fundamentals, large-scale buyback program can elevate both market perception\
  \ and fundamental value.\n\n\n\n#### Gnosis DAO assets breakdown\n\nThis discussion\
  \ is centered on the marketable tokens and illiquid venture deals & investments\
  \ in venture capital funds, specifically excluding other significant assets like\
  \ Gnosis Chain, Gnosis Pay, and Gnosis Wallet.\n\n  1. Marketable tokens\n\n\n\n\
  As of today, Gnosis DAO holds $631 million in tradable tokens, not including GNO\
  \ (this number corresponds to the assets that belong to Gnosis DAO that we could\
  \ locate onchain). This figure serves as a foundation for valuing Gnosis DAO’s assets.\
  \ It’s important to note that not all these assets are immediately liquid. For example,\
  \ approximately half of the SAFE token allocation is yet to vest. Furthermore, a\
  \ significant portion of both SAFE and OLAS tokens has been voluntarily placed into\
  \ lock-up contracts to demonstrate commitment. The primary assets in the treasury\
  \ include ETH and equivalents, SAFE, stablecoins, OLAS, and COW. In 2023, the treasury\
  \ generated $10.2 million by engaging these assets in DeFi activities.\n\n![VPau_nVKOjhDRId2w8Tz2X8ttgofE5ZE6vNrVUcJeCMbr5ZWkB_6hWJWLSScpZi57gjA3aiCVSNo1cwUqXa7b-IfTzGCs8MrTu0CXtYLQqSOAAWidd2V_3-1VYPo](https://forum.gnosis.io/uploads/default/original/2X/7/73744391d6708b211cc8dc54e50788ac005a0829.png)\n\
  \nAdditionally, Gnosis DAO has a 50% stake in the Safe <> Gnosis joint treasury,\
  \ which owns 5% of the SAFE token supply, valued at approximately $115 million currently.\
  \ These assets are not included in the above calculation.\n\n  2. Illiquid venture\
  \ deals\n\n\n\nAccording to the [list](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/introducing-gnosis-3-0/8252/3)\
  \ published by Ernst on this forum, Gnosis DAO has made about 50 venture investments\
  \ over the years either directly or through in-house Factor VC.\n\nInvestments that\
  \ remain illiquid/are not located include:\n\nFlashbots, Matter Labs (ZKsync), Aztec,\
  \ RISC Zero, IDEX, Succinct, Orca, Anoma, Zerion, POAP, ImmuneFi, WalletConnect,\
  \ [Kinetex.io](http://Kinetex.io), Fileverse, NFTfi, [Li.Fi](http://Li.Fi), Hedgey,\
  \ Azuro, Harbor, Snapshot, Diva, Phaver, Rated Network, [Mimic.fI](http://Mimic.fI),\
  \ Sablier, Coinshift, Vibe.xyz, Parcel, Mean.finance, Collab, AMMalgam, Topos, Bootnode,\
  \ Stablelab, Backed, Least Authority, Cypherock, Gateway.fm, Den, Mystiko, Shutter,\
  \ Altlayer, Karpatkey (spinoff).\n\nAdditionally, Gnosis DAO is an LP in the following\
  \ VC funds:\n\n1kx, Lightshift, LongHash Ventures, Seed Club Ventures.\n\nWhile\
  \ it is challenging to precisely value these illiquid venture deals due to many\
  \ unknown variables, this portfolio includes high-profile deals and ensures growth\
  \ in Gnosis DAO liquid treasury as these tokens launch and vest, widening the discount\
  \ at which GNO is currently trading.\n\n#### Gnosis DAO’s GNO holdings\n\nAccording\
  \ to CoinGecko, the circulating supply of GNO tokens is listed as 2,589,589, which\
  \ is valued at approximately $703 million. However, this figure does not include\
  \ 1,050,884 GNO tokens owned by Gnosis DAO, many of which were acquired through\
  \ buybacks and are unlikely to be released into circulation, at least before GNO\
  \ is back to its book value. Therefore, the actual circulating supply is reduced\
  \ to 1,538,705 GNO, amounting to approximately $424 million.\n\n#### GNO book value\n\
  \nWith our ballpark estimate of the venture book & investments in VCs at $100 million,\
  \ we arrive at $730 million in assets. With the current GNO real market cap at $424\
  \ million, it’s currently trading 42% below its book value of $475. To reach its\
  \ book value, GNO has to appreciate by about 72% based on current numbers. Since\
  \ the treasury contains volatile assets, it should be calculated dynamically as\
  \ the program progresses.\n\nIt is important to note that the book value of GNO\
  \ does not fully represent its intrinsic value, which should also account for future\
  \ cash flows generated by the DAO. Therefore, the book value should be considered\
  \ merely a baseline or minimum value before the DAO decides to spend any GNO it\
  \ already owns or acquires through this program.\n\n#### Proposed execution\n\n\
  To address the undervaluation of GNO and effectively utilize the treasury assets,\
  \ we propose allocating approximately 5% of the treasury funds, amounting to $30\
  \ million, for a structured buyback strategy. This amount will be divided into two\
  \ distinct parts, each employing a different strategy to optimize the overall impact.\n\
  \n  1. CoW-TWAP\n\n\n  * Allocates $15 million over 6 months;\n  * Executes orders\
  \ at any price below the dynamically calculated book value of GNO;\n  * Results\
  \ into $83,333 daily buy pressure.\n\n\n  2. Discretionary, executed by Karpatkey\n\
  \n\n  * Allocates $15 million;\n  * Provides Karpatkey with full discretion to capitalize\
  \ on the best opportunities.\n\n\n\n#### Assessment\n\nAfter the conclusion of the\
  \ program, we should assess its results and consider whether to continue, modify,\
  \ or end the buyback strategy going forward.\n\n4 Likes\n\n[Curia Delegate Platform](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/curia-delegate-platform/8279/3)\n\

  \nThank you for your detailed proposal.\n\nOver 50% of my entire crypto portfolio\
  \ is in GNO, so I would benefit massively as an investor, but imo it is way too\
  \ early to spend the money for buybacks. The only relevant metric is the FREE Cash\
  \ flow, I don’t think we have the numbers and I think it is still negative at this\
  \ point. Gnosis is just starting to launch the 3.0 phase with new apps like the\
  \ GNO VPN, GNO pay etc., GNO Chain is still in the development phase. It makes much\
  \ more sense to invest the money in new apps/the current apps. We need multiple\
  \ DAPPs which generate enough cash flow, before we can think about buybacks.\n\n\
  For immediate measures, I suggest that we improve the utility of the GNO token.\
  \ The lending market situation still hasn’t improved.\n\nI also think that the 30\
  \ mil are not really relevant in the current market conditions. We can start to\
  \ pump again and the market cap can easily increase 200-300 million in a couple\
  \ of weeks. We can also get the opposite and 30 mil buybacks won’t make a difference.\n\
  \nI think that buybacks will be necessary at a certain point though. The current\
  \ crypto space is dominated by unsophisticated gamblers, GNO will attract more attention\
  \ atm with launching a memetoken. I like to compare crypto protocols like AAVE,\
  \ MKR, GNO with the “old economy” stocks like cement companies etc., they generate\
  \ revenue, but they are not the new fancy thing, so they have to return the capital\
  \ to the investors at a certain point.\n\n6 Likes\n\n[Nay](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Nay)\
  \ May 17, 2024, 2:20pm  3\n\nThanks for your response.\n\nThe DAO holds a massive\
  \ treasury of $630 million, which as stated in the proposal is the second-largest\
  \ treasury of any DAO. The choice you explained, between investing funds into r&d\
  \ and doing buybacks, doesn’t exist. The DAO has more than enough assets for both\
  \ and more. In fact, to the best of my knowledge, Gnosis DAO assets are not used\
  \ for r&d – it’s funded by Ltd. – which is a separate well-funded entity. It is,\
  \ in this case, cashflow positive.\n\nBuybacks have been concluded before, in the\
  \ last year the figure is comparable (although smaller) to what is proposed here.\
  \ This proposal is aimed, above all, at providing structure to this program and\
  \ signaling the market intentions of the DAO. Given that GNO often trades in a low\
  \ single-digit $million of daily volume, I think you underestimate the impact $30\
  \ million of buybacks can make.\n\nAn important point is that Gnosis DAO holds 40%\
  \ of the circulating GNO, which it can’t currently spend on growth because this\
  \ would result in a negative value transfer from long-term holders. Bringing GNO\
  \ back above the book value is not merely “pumping our bags”, it’s actually in the\
  \ best interest of long-term GNO holders because it will enable growth initiatives.\n\

  \ 2:48pm  4\n\nThank you [@Nay](/u/nay) for the proposal and [@Wunderbernd](/u/wunderbernd)\
  \ for the comment.\n\nFirst, I very much agree with [@Wunderbernd](/u/wunderbernd)\
  \ is that the relevant metric is “free cashflow” or how I would call it: producing\
  \ goods and services that provide so much value that users are willing to pay for\
  \ it.\n\nNow I do think that Gnosis has produced a bunch of those products:\n\n\
  \  * the chain itself\n  * Gnosis Pay\n  * EURe on Gnosis (<https://uramp.gnosis.io/>)\n\
  \  * Cowswap (on Gnosis)\n  * lending markets on Gnosis (where Gnosis has partially\
  \ a stake in (Spark))\n  * …\n\n\n\nSo while we continue to do R&D and starting\
  \ new ventures (e.g. GnosisVPN, AI agents, potentially some prediction markets plays\
  \ again) I think it is now crucial to focus on (user) growth of the products mentioned\
  \ above. The result should be much more users using our products and paying fees\
  \ (or how you call it: “free cashflow”).\n\nNow, for such a growth program we should\
  \ spend money and it does make sense to use GNO here, as we want as many as possible\
  \ of the users of Gnosis chain also be owner of the chain (aka GNO holder) as we\
  \ generally believe in distributed ownership but also out of pure self-interest\
  \ think a more decentralized chain can be more valuable. (credible neutral blockspace\
  \ will be more valuable than centralized blockspace with some security guarentees\
  \ (most L2s)).\n\nSo long story short - I think it is time to do a large user growth\
  \ GNO incentive program. (it needs to designed in a way to actually attact real\
  \ people and not just a “farming program” that gets “farmed” with capital and of\
  \ course it should also not be Sybil attackable).\n\nIf we spend GNO for incentives\
  \ we are essentially “selling GNO” to finance “growth expense”. Now this is the\
  \ point where the GNO price matters - if we are selling GNO we don’t want to sell\
  \ them below what they are worth.\n\nSo in summary - I am in favor of this proposal\
  \ if it is connected to a growth program where the GNO aquired in the buy back are\
  \ consequently used to attract more user. I had been working on such a program for\
  \ a while and share more here is the forum soon but will also present those ideas\
  \ at my “Circles 2.0 talk” at Dappcon next week. (spoiler: Circles can help addressing\
  \ the challenges mentioned above) and can yet be another “product” that attracts\
  \ users to Gnosis.\n\n12 Likes\n\n[Wunderbernd](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Wunderbernd)\

  Thanks for this proposal, I can understand it from an investment point of view focusing\
  \ on capital gains of an investment.\n\nBut actually, who is really benefiting from\
  \ buybacks? In short term only the ppl who like to get out of their investment (or\
  \ at least reduce it) while it makes it more expensive for ppl who like to start\
  \ or increase their exposure.\n\nAs long as we like to grow our user (and holder)\
  \ base, I don’t see a need to artificially increase the price of gno by buybacks,\
  \ but would favor to attract ppl by pointing to your very well summarized undervaluation\
  \ of GNO.\n\n1 Like\n\n[RaulVolker](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/RaulVolker) May 17,\
  \ 2024, 7:13pm  7\n\nWhile I agree with you - some people will just sell their position\
  \ once buybacks kick in and gno price appreciates - i don’t think your argument\
  \ is valid overall. I think there are two perspectives on this that show buybacks\
  \ are very reasonable in this situation\n\n  1. Sure, if the dao can invest in projects\
  \ that are even more profitable than buybacks and/or are important to the gnosis\
  \ ecosystem then it should prioritise that. However it seems very unlikely all of\
  \ the funds currently held by gnosis dao will be used for that. And then buying\
  \ back tokens undervalued just means you can create value for gno holders or sell/spend\
  \ them again (e.g. in a way martin suggested) once gno is not undervalued as much\
  \ anymore\n\n  2. taking your argument to the extreme, it would not hurt gnosis\
  \ dao if gno price went to $1 right now. that is simply not true. once again - i\
  \ agree with you that making more profitable investments or making good investments\
  \ into gnosis ecosystem is more important, but you cannot rule out creating value\
  \ for gno holders at some point, otherwise there won’t be many gno holders left\
  \ (like why would you hold the token longterm if the token doesn’t hold any value?).\n\
  \n\n\n\nimo a gno price appreciation will lead to more interest in gno, more interest\
  \ in gno ecosystem, that leads to higher gno price again and so on.\n\ni have no\
  \ idea why gno is so undervalued, but this looks extreme enough to take advantage\
  \ of the situation\n\n2 Likes\n\n[gno-investor](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/gno-investor)\
  \ May 17, 2024, 8:40pm  8\n\nThank you [@Nay](/u/nay)\n\nI would like to see a program\
  \ for unlimited buybacks of GNO tokens on the open market whenever they are trading\
  \ below book value (as they are now). This strategy would provide several compelling\
  \ benefits:\n\n  1. **Zero-Risk Investment** : Buybacks below book value represent\
  \ a zero-risk investment for token holders, as the value is directly returned to\
  \ them. This ensures that capital is utilized in the most efficient manner, directly\
  \ benefiting all token holders.\n\n  2. **Market Confidence** : Announcing a clear\
  \ commitment to buybacks can significantly boost market confidence. Often, the mere\
  \ announcement of such a policy is enough to prevent the tokens from trading below\
  \ their intrinsic value.\n\n  3. **Internal Confidence** : When a DAO undertakes\
  \ buybacks, it signals strong internal confidence in the project’s future. It shows\
  \ that the community and governance believe in the long-term success and stability\
  \ of GnosisDAO, reinforcing trust among token holders.\n\n  4. **Optimized Capital\
  \ Allocation** : This strategy aligns with intelligent investing principles, ensuring\
  \ that the capital is deployed where it can generate the highest guaranteed returns\
  \ for token holders. Unlike other investments that might carry risks, buybacks below\
  \ book value offer a sure way to enhance token holder value.\n\n\n\n\nGiven GnosisDAO’s\
  \ 9-year presence in the market, it is clear that this is not a short-lived startup\
  \ but a well-established entity. With ample capital reserves, GnosisDAO is in a\
  \ strong position to invest heavily while taking advantage of this optimal investment\
  \ opportunity. This unique situation positions GnosisDAO as both a growth and value\
  \ investment, which is highly unusual and advantageous.\n\nI support this proposal,\
  \ but it would be even better to create a permanent mechanism to ensure that GnosisDAO\
  \ can continuously execute buybacks whenever GNO tokens trade below book value.\n\

  \ to use the assets, that are more valuable.\n\nBut despite the large treasury I\

  \ by Karpatkey to earn income and as collateral and to foster liquidity on GC?\n\
  \  * Stables which are also much needed there till other parties will join?\n  *\
  \ Many other assets, like OLAS or COW that hardly have enough liquidity to be sold\

  This proposal, among other things, aims to give this process the structure and signal\

  \ Alternatives are executing buybacks quietly or not executing at all, both of which\
  \ I would argue are suboptimal and don’t lead to generating more interest and activity\

  \ above its book, no more buybacks are needed, and GNO could be spent on other initiatives\
  \ because more people view it as a sound investment.\n\nLike it or not, the price\

  \ other assets and have IL\n  3. Lending markets → The current lending markets have\
  \ isolated markets and bad LTV\n\n\n\nAs someone who doesn’t want to sell his GNO\
  \ because I think it is undervalued, only the first option is attractive right now.\n\
  \nIf we compare ETH with GNO, a reason why the ETH price is so stable, is because\
  \ they have efficient lending markets for ETH. ETH maxis don’t have to sell their\
  \ ETH, they can just borrow against it.\n\nIn my opinion we have to improve the\
  \ utility of the GNO token to maximize the benefits of buybacks.\n\n2 Likes\n\n\

  \ topics but like to add one more reason why ethereum is more resilient than $GNO:\
  \ it’s a much larger crowd looking at it and thereby stabilizing the price. As pointed\
  \ out above, a single entity can move the $GNO price much and these decisions, at\
  \ least I suppose, are done by very few ppl controlling directly and/or indirectly\
  \ the majority of $GNO.  \nAlthough I am convinced they did it with the best intentions\
  \ this should be prevented in the future.\n\nSome algorithmic buybacks might be\
  \ good, even a decision of the DAO to hand over the ability to decide about certain\
  \ specifics to a entity like karpatkey might be fine in some situations. But at\
  \ least after a trade (or a series of trades) was done this has to be published\
  \ along with the results. Or did I just missed this in the regular updates from\
  \ karpatkey?\n\n2 Likes\n\n[john_szczepaniak](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/john_szczepaniak)\
  \ May 20, 2024, 12:16pm  19\n\nThank you for the detailed and well-written GIP [@Nay](/u/nay).\
  \ GNO trading well below its book value does present challenges in regards to the\
  \ growth flywheel of Gnosis (and more generally any project in web3).\n\nYet, crypto\
  \ is still largely a game of hot potato or musical chairs with folks either farming\
  \ incentives (airdrops, points etc) or VCs dumping on retail. For the most part,\
  \ the new shiny projects, new infra or new products see the same hot potato of capital\
  \ move through with the same dynamics at play. While a higher GNO price would be\
  \ great, the question still remains - if most token holders are fickle, how do we\
  \ introduce a level of stickiness around GNO?\n\nI agree with [@Wunderbernd](/u/wunderbernd)\
  \ [@mkoeppelmann](/u/mkoeppelmann) and [@refri](/u/refri) \\- we want the community\
  \ of GNO token holders to materially share in the upside of Gnosis becoming broadly\
  \ relevant. I believe we achieve that through finding real product market fit by\
  \ building products people actually want to use and funneling them in through GNO\
  \ incentives to spark the flywheel. There are many things to address that we could\
  \ fold into GNO incentives as Gnosis 3.0 products are still in their infancy. Or\
  \ simply improving the liquidity of money markets on Gnosis Chain seems to be something\
  \ critical to solve for as we position Gnosis Chain as the payment chain - a key\
  \ building block if we want to be broadly relevant.\n\nAt this point in time, I\
  \ would rather see $30 million spent on building killer products that resonate with\
  \ real, everyday people. GNO trading under its book value presents an asymmetric\
  \ risk/reward, an opportunity for the Gnosis community to participate in the upside.\
  \ I’d rather be in this position than having an overvalued GNO price as most would\
  \ view the upside as exhausted. While I think your GIP is aimed at the right goal,\
  \ I support the comments voiced by the community.\n\n5 Likes\n\n[owl.gno](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/owl.gno)\
  \ May 20, 2024, 1:12pm  20\n\nThank you so much for the GIP, I am a big fan of it.\n\
  \nLike most of the participants in this discussion I agree Gnosis is extremely undervalued.\
  \ I also agree with them that our treasury should be an important asset to create\
  \ new businesses and cash flow positive projects.\n\nHowever I don’t agree with\
  \ them that Gnosis price doesn’t matter, in fact I think keeping a floor in the\
  \ price of Gnosis when we are extremely under book value is very important, as Gnosis\
  \ is our biggest asset in the treasury and it can be used for all of the investments\
  \ discussed here.\n\nLong story short, higher Gnosis price means more firepower\
  \ to create and invest in future EV+ products.\n\n1 Like\n\n[eklureuil](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/eklureuil)\
  \ May 20, 2024, 4:43pm  21\n\nPretty interesting topic and discussion.  \nWhile\
  \ at first sight, the proposal was very interesting (as i do believe $GNO is very\
  \ undervalued by the crypto market at the moment), it seems to me that the DAO could\
  \ make a better use of the treasury.  \nOne point that came during the previous\
  \ answers is the lack of lending markets for $GNO (isolated pool on Aave, cant be\
  \ used as collateral on Spark, and Agave is retiring). The only option for $GNO\
  \ holders is to sell (not even talking about leveraging their position).  \nMaybe\
  \ some kind of incentives could be deployed in this direction ? Or bring back the\
  \ discussions ‘Gno as collateral’ with Aave/Maker teams ?\n\n3 Likes\n\n**[next\
