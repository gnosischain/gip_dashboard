  \    funding:<$30 million>\n    \n\n#### Category\n\nTreasury\n\n#### TL;DR\n\n\
  I represent [Thanefield Capital](https://thanefield.capital/), a multi-strategy\
  \ crypto fund; GNO is one of our thesis-driven investments.\n\nCurrently, GNO is\
  \ significantly undervalued relative to its book value. To address this, we propose\
  \ initiating a large-scale buyback program. Our plan involves deploying $30 million,\
  \ representing about 5% of the estimated assets of Gnosis DAO, over a six-month\
  \ period.\n\n#### Introduction\n\nGnosis DAO has consistently been at the forefront\
  \ of innovation, successfully developing and launching products such as Safe and\
  \ CoW Protocol. These initiatives began as internal projects and were later spun\
  \ off into independent ventures. Despite these successes and several previous rounds\
  \ of buybacks, the GNO token has not adequately reflected the value generated by\
  \ these and numerous other activities.\n\nGNO is currently trading below its book\
  \ value, considering only the marketable tokens owned by Gnosis DAO. This valuation\
  \ suggests that the market is assigning a negative value to all other Gnosis DAO\
  \ assets. These assets include, but are not limited to, Gnosis Chain, Gnosis Pay,\
  \ Gnosis Wallet, Circles, a venture capital portfolio of over 40 companies, and\
  \ investments in four crypto VCs. This means that long-term GNO holders have not\
  \ financially benefited from the DAO’s successes in product development, venture\
  \ investments, and treasury management. Additionally, it becomes uneconomic to allocate\
  \ any GNO that already belong to the DAO for ecosystem growth or other initiatives,\
  \ as it would result in a negative value transfer for the DAO.\n\nGnosis DAO is\
  \ well-positioned to address this undervaluation as one of the most capitalized\
  \ DAOs, holding over $630 million in assets and ranking second only to Mantle in\
  \ terms of non-native marketable tokens. We propose initiating a substantial buyback\
  \ program to correct this disparity. If approved by a DAO vote, [@Karpatkey](/u/karpatkey)\
  \ will manage the execution of this program.\n\nIt’s important to note that this\
  \ proposal operates independently but complements the vision outlined in [Gnosis\
  \ DAO v3](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/introducing-gnosis-3-0/8252), which aims to\
  \ establish protocol-owned liquidity between GNO and portfolio projects. If approved\
  \ by the DAO, these initiatives should progress concurrently.\n\n#### Objectives\
  \ of the program\n\n  1. Transfer value from sellers to long-term holders by acquiring\
  \ GNO below its intrinsic value. The acquired tokens could then be utilized for\
  \ treasury swaps, incentives, growth initiatives, and further investments.\n  2.\
  \ Signal to the market a commitment to establishing a valuation floor for GNO that\
  \ consistently exceeds its book value.\n  3. Drive attention to the products of\
  \ the DAO. Given the attention-driven nature of the crypto market, where price often\
  \ influences fundamentals, large-scale buyback program can elevate both market perception\
  \ and fundamental value.\n\n\n\n#### Gnosis DAO assets breakdown\n\nThis discussion\
  \ is centered on the marketable tokens and illiquid venture deals & investments\
  \ in venture capital funds, specifically excluding other significant assets like\
  \ Gnosis Chain, Gnosis Pay, and Gnosis Wallet.\n\n  1. Marketable tokens\n\n\n\n\
  As of today, Gnosis DAO holds $631 million in tradable tokens, not including GNO\
  \ (this number corresponds to the assets that belong to Gnosis DAO that we could\
  \ locate onchain). This figure serves as a foundation for valuing Gnosis DAO’s assets.\
  \ It’s important to note that not all these assets are immediately liquid. For example,\
  \ approximately half of the SAFE token allocation is yet to vest. Furthermore, a\
  \ significant portion of both SAFE and OLAS tokens has been voluntarily placed into\
  \ lock-up contracts to demonstrate commitment. The primary assets in the treasury\
  \ include ETH and equivalents, SAFE, stablecoins, OLAS, and COW. In 2023, the treasury\
  \ generated $10.2 million by engaging these assets in DeFi activities.\n\n![VPau_nVKOjhDRId2w8Tz2X8ttgofE5ZE6vNrVUcJeCMbr5ZWkB_6hWJWLSScpZi57gjA3aiCVSNo1cwUqXa7b-IfTzGCs8MrTu0CXtYLQqSOAAWidd2V_3-1VYPo](https://forum.gnosis.io/uploads/default/original/2X/7/73744391d6708b211cc8dc54e50788ac005a0829.png)\n\
  \nAdditionally, Gnosis DAO has a 50% stake in the Safe <> Gnosis joint treasury,\
  \ which owns 5% of the SAFE token supply, valued at approximately $115 million currently.\
  \ These assets are not included in the above calculation.\n\n  2. Illiquid venture\
  \ deals\n\n\n\nAccording to the [list](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/introducing-gnosis-3-0/8252/3)\
  \ published by Ernst on this forum, Gnosis DAO has made about 50 venture investments\
  \ over the years either directly or through in-house Factor VC.\n\nInvestments that\
  \ remain illiquid/are not located include:\n\nFlashbots, Matter Labs (ZKsync), Aztec,\
  \ RISC Zero, IDEX, Succinct, Orca, Anoma, Zerion, POAP, ImmuneFi, WalletConnect,\
  \ [Kinetex.io](http://Kinetex.io), Fileverse, NFTfi, [Li.Fi](http://Li.Fi), Hedgey,\
  \ Azuro, Harbor, Snapshot, Diva, Phaver, Rated Network, [Mimic.fI](http://Mimic.fI),\
  \ Sablier, Coinshift, Vibe.xyz, Parcel, Mean.finance, Collab, AMMalgam, Topos, Bootnode,\
  \ Stablelab, Backed, Least Authority, Cypherock, Gateway.fm, Den, Mystiko, Shutter,\
  \ Altlayer, Karpatkey (spinoff).\n\nAdditionally, Gnosis DAO is an LP in the following\
  \ VC funds:\n\n1kx, Lightshift, LongHash Ventures, Seed Club Ventures.\n\nWhile\
  \ it is challenging to precisely value these illiquid venture deals due to many\
  \ unknown variables, this portfolio includes high-profile deals and ensures growth\
  \ in Gnosis DAO liquid treasury as these tokens launch and vest, widening the discount\
  \ at which GNO is currently trading.\n\n#### Gnosis DAO’s GNO holdings\n\nAccording\
  \ to CoinGecko, the circulating supply of GNO tokens is listed as 2,589,589, which\
  \ is valued at approximately $703 million. However, this figure does not include\
  \ 1,050,884 GNO tokens owned by Gnosis DAO, many of which were acquired through\
  \ buybacks and are unlikely to be released into circulation, at least before GNO\
  \ is back to its book value. Therefore, the actual circulating supply is reduced\
  \ to 1,538,705 GNO, amounting to approximately $424 million.\n\n#### GNO book value\n\
  \nWith our ballpark estimate of the venture book & investments in VCs at $100 million,\
  \ we arrive at $730 million in assets. With the current GNO real market cap at $424\
  \ million, it’s currently trading 42% below its book value of $475. To reach its\
  \ book value, GNO has to appreciate by about 72% based on current numbers. Since\
  \ the treasury contains volatile assets, it should be calculated dynamically as\
  \ the program progresses.\n\nIt is important to note that the book value of GNO\
  \ does not fully represent its intrinsic value, which should also account for future\
  \ cash flows generated by the DAO. Therefore, the book value should be considered\
  \ merely a baseline or minimum value before the DAO decides to spend any GNO it\
  \ already owns or acquires through this program.\n\n#### Proposed execution\n\n\
  To address the undervaluation of GNO and effectively utilize the treasury assets,\
  \ we propose allocating approximately 5% of the treasury funds, amounting to $30\
  \ million, for a structured buyback strategy. This amount will be divided into two\
  \ distinct parts, each employing a different strategy to optimize the overall impact.\n\
  \n  1. CoW-TWAP\n\n\n  * Allocates $15 million over 6 months;\n  * Executes orders\
  \ at any price below the dynamically calculated book value of GNO;\n  * Results\
  \ into $83,333 daily buy pressure.\n\n\n  2. Discretionary, executed by Karpatkey\n\
  \n\n  * Allocates $15 million;\n  * Provides Karpatkey with full discretion to capitalize\
  \ on the best opportunities.\n\n\n\n#### Assessment\n\nAfter the conclusion of the\
  \ program, we should assess its results and consider whether to continue, modify,\
  \ or end the buyback strategy going forward.\n\n6 Likes\n\n[Curia Delegate Platform](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/curia-delegate-platform/8279/3)\n\
