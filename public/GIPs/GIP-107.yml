title: Should the GnosisDAO form, in addition to the Gnosis Asset Holdings I Foundation,
  a legal conduit to continue to foster Gnosis´ decentralization goals?
body: "The GnosisDAO (the “DAO”) approved, with the successful passage of GIP-94,\
  \ the establishment of a legal conduit, Gnosis Asset Holdings I Foundation, which\
  \ was set up to onboard Centrifuge Prime (as described in GIP-94) and to also hold\
  \ other illiquid investments, including those made historically by the Gnosis Builders\
  \ as described in GIP-96.\n\nThis proposal intends to seek a vote from the DAO to\
  \ establish another legal conduit, the Gnosis Operations Foundation (the “Foundation”),\
  \ to provide the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work in a decentralized\
  \ environment.\n\nFor reference: \n\nGIP-94 https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-94-should-the-gnosisdao-approve-the-gnosis-assets-holding-i-foundation-for-onboarding-into-centrifuge-prime/8331\n\
