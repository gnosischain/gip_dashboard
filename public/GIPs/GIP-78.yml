  \ Treasury Allocation (Proposal#2)\n    author: Gnosis Guild\n    status: Draft\n\
  \    type: Funding\n    created: 2023-01-30\n    \n\n  * Let’s do this!\n  * Make\
  \ no change\n\n\n\n0 voters\n\n##  Simple Summary\n\nThe proposal will fund the\
  \ Gnosis Guild’s operations for one year. The Gnosis Guild treasury allocation would\
  \ continue to foster needs-driven development for the GnosisDAO and of the Zodiac\
  \ ecosystem at a total of $3,823,575 paid in 56% DAI and 44% GNO for our contributor\
  \ compensation plan, administered by Gnosis Guild following the vesting schedule\
  \ laid out in the Gnosis token plan.\n\n##  Abstract\n\nGnosis Guild is a society\
  \ dedicated to interdependent software and the growth of the Zodiac Standard. In\
  \ 2022, Gnosis Guild completed a year of needs-driven development for the GnosisDAO\
  \ and continued to grow the Zodiac ecosystem. With this proposal, Gnosis Guild requests\
  \ funding to continue its development of GnosisDAO’s infrastructure, expand the\
  \ Zodiac collection of tools, and further establish Gnosis Chain as an ideal ecosystem\
  \ for DAOs. The budget allocation includes funds for key personnel, operations,\
  \ grants programs, and other areas as needed to sustain this commitment.\n\n## \
  \ Motivation\n\nWe are a small, but growing, team rooted in conviviality, mutualistic\
  \ ownership, and experimentation. Since our last proposal, a year ago, we have completed\
  \ many projects focused in 4 main areas: supporting GnosisDAO, developing novel\
  \ treasury management tools, developing the Zodiac ecosystem, and convivial software\
  \ experiments.\n\nAn effective and productive DAO implicitly spreads the technology\
  \ on which it’s built; this is the core of our symbiotic relationship with GnosisDAO,\
  \ and by extension, Gnosis Chain. In these early days of our organization, it is\
  \ important to demonstrate the effectiveness of Zodiac by supporting Gnosis’s efforts\
  \ to promote decentralized infrastructure. In the past year we have completed:\n\
  \n  * [GnosisDAO SAFE Distribution Tooling](https://claim-safe.gnosis.io/)—a system\
  \ to transparently calculate, distribute, and claim the portion of SAFE tokens vested\
  \ to GNO holders.\n  * [GIP 28 & 44: Allow GNO holders to vote with invested/staked/locked\
  \ positions in Mainnet/GC](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-28-allow-gno-holders-to-vote-even-if-their-gno-are-invested-staked-locked-in-smart-contracts-in-different-protocols-networks/2357/18)—We\
  \ deployed a significant upgrade to the GnosisDAO’s governance structure, allowing\
  \ GNO, LGNO, and MGNO on Mainnet and Gnosis Chain to participate in voting.\n  *\
  \ [Reality Module Improvements](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-reality)—We\
  \ have made significant improvements to the Reality Module used for GnosisDAO’s\
  \ governance.\n  * [CowSwap Locking Contract](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/candidate-deployment-of-cow-vesting-contracts-for-those-who-locked-gno/4208)—A\
  \ GNO locking contract, for CoW Protocol, for calculating $COW that will be awarded\
  \ to GNO holders that lock their GNO\n\n\n\nGnosis has one of the most productive\
  \ DAO treasuries, due to Karpatkey’s skillful management. Our tooling plays a key\
  \ role in their day to day activities, and was a core component to Karpatkey winning\
  \ the bids to manage Balancer’s and ENS’s treasuries. By supporting the effective\
  \ management of Gnosis’s treasury, we help ensure the long term support of Gnosis\
  \ Chain. In the past year we have built:\n\n  * [Zodiac Roles Module](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles)\
  \ —The Roles Module enables enforced granular, role-based, permissions for attached\
  \ modules. In combination with the Pilot App, [Karpatkey has utilized these tools](https://medium.com/karpatkeydao/framework-for-an-active-dao-treasury-execution-a30b0b287bb8)\
  \ to securely manage treasury funds in a non-custodial way, and was a key factor\
  \ in their successful ENS treasury bid. Version 2 of the roles mod will allow for\
  \ even greater granularity and modularity.\n  * [Pilot ](https://pilot.gnosisguild.org/)Extension\
  \ — The Pilot Extension allows a treasury management team to build a batch of transactions,\
  \ simulate them and queue them as a transaction on any Safe, whether it is using\
  \ Zodiac modules or not.\n  * [Zodiac Siphon Module](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-siphon)—\
  \ This MEV friendly module allows any Safe to make funds transferable from a money\
  \ market into a debt position when undercollateralized. Karpatkey will use this\
  \ to service Maker debt requirements (once audit is complete) .\n\n\n\nThe Zodiac\
  \ ecosystem continues to grow, both culturally and in toolset. Deployed on Gnosis\
  \ Chain (and other EVM compatible chains), our collection of open source modules\
  \ sees regular contributions and use. Zodiac tooling combined with cheap and fast\
  \ transactions make Gnosis Chain the optimal place for DAOs. This year Zodiac has\
  \ expanded with these developments:\n\n  * [Zodiac Wiki](https://zodiac.wiki/index.php/ZODIAC.WIKI)\
  \ — This wiki is home to a shared library of reading materials, documentation, stories,\
  \ and a pattern language describing common problems and offering practical responses\
  \ for DAOs.\n  * [Zodiac Exit Mod and App](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-exit)\
  \ — This mod allows specified token holders to redeem a designated token for a portion\
  \ of a Safe’s fungible assets.\n  * Zodiac [Governor Mod](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-oz-governor)\
  \ — This makes Governor style DAOs Safe compatible, bringing the security and flexibility\
  \ of the Safe to the most popular on-chain governance method.\n  * [MolochDAO](https://daohaus.substack.com/p/6991f40b-3931-47ff-bea3-fa6f9c365135?s=r)s\
  \ can now control Safes— DAOHaus made their minion contracts Zodiac compatible.\n\
  \n\n\nWith this treasury allocation, Gnosis Guild will continue to carry out needs-driven\
  \ development for GnosisDAO’s infrastructure, executing on emergent GIPs and DAO\
  \ requirements as we have demonstrated the past year. Furthermore, we will continue\
  \ to serve Gnosis Chain’s DAO ecosystem growth by expanding the Zodiac collection\
  \ of tools and the Zodiac Wiki. We will also continue our partnership with Karpatkey\
  \ to serve GnosisDAO’s treasury management.\n\nIn 2023/2024, Gnosis Guild plans\
  \ to complete its spin out from Gnosis Ltd/Gnosis Services GmbH, forming a separate\
  \ entity based on mutualistic ownership and decentralized governance. The Gnosis\
  \ Guild entity will continue with the same team, objectives, and values, executing\
  \ on this GIP and our symbiotic relationship with GnosisDAO. This grant will be\
  \ made to Gnosis Ltd., and once the spin out is complete all grant assets will be\
  \ transferred to the Gnosis Guild entity.\n\n##  Specification\n\n[Gnosis Guild\
  \ Treasury Budget 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qyXGxCAk2GmiH4jz7tbtOIqNO6PBxghMQ3lsLZbMz7o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\
  \n##  Rationale\n\nGnosis Guild’s chief priority in 2023 remains needs-driven development\
  \ for the GnosisDAO and other DAOs within or engaged by the Gnosis ecosystem, along\
  \ with expanding the suite of composable DAO tooling and mechanisms available for\
  \ the Ethereum and Gnosis ecosystems. Keeping that in mind, the Gnosis Guild treasury\
  \ allocation budget has the following categories with their rationale described\
  \ below:\n\nCore Contributors: This budget category refers to the salaries and token\
  \ plan for 15 full-time contributors with the following roles\n\n  * 1 communications\
  \ and community role\n  * 1 operations role\n  * 1 business development role\n \
  \ * 12 engineering and product roles\n\n\n\nThe contributor incentivization plan\
  \ is intended to roughly double contributors’ salary, with an initial two-year cliff\
  \ followed by a rolling one-year holding period.\n\nStewards: This budget category\
  \ refers to the part-time payment for 2-4 “pod” roles to extend outreach, education,\
  \ and documentation of the Zodiac ecosystem, as well as assist with general community\
  \ and communications needs related to Gnosis Guild.\n\nBrand Design: This budget\
  \ category refers to contract-based payment for visual communications.\n\nGrants\
  \ Program: This budget category refers to the amount allocated to support initiatives\
  \ building on Zodiac and related DAO tooling.\n\nOps: This budget category refers\
  \ to operational costs related to administration, services, and subscriptions.\n\
  \nCultural Program: This budget category refers to what would traditionally be construed\
  \ as a marketing campaign. The cultural program is intended to further establish\
  \ Gnosis Guild’s reputation as a creative, editorial, and experimental team, while\
  \ seeking to meaningfully broaden discourse.\n\n16 Likes\n\n[samepant](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/samepant)\

  \ this proposal.\n\n3 Likes\n\n[Adam_tosz](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Adam_tosz)\
  \ February 6, 2023, 7:39am  3\n\nI wanted to take this opportunity for a shout out\
  \ to the Zodiac team. In the past year, great tools were developed and services\
  \ rendered by the Zodiac team. Thus, sorry to hear the Zodiac team leaving Gnosis\
  \ this / next year.\n\nWith regards to the proposal:\n\n**1\\. On the proposed budget**\
  \  \nI think it is fairly similar to the 2022 Budget, however 1.000 GNO / employee\
  \ compensation on top of a >$115k average compensation appears too high, especially\
  \ for non-senior technical personnel (operations role, communications, BD, junior\
  \ developer). Imho it is not unrealistic that GNO might be at $200- $250 at the\
  \ end of the year. Therefore I suggest to cap the GNO compensation at $100k p.a.\
  \ on the date of payout. GnosisDAO can transfer the equivalent amount of GNO in\
  \ the month of payout once known.\n\n**2\\. Funding**  \nThe Zodiac team did great\
  \ contributions to Karpatkey, leading to several wins recently. However all the\
  \ funding is coming from GnosisDAO. Doesn’t it makes sense to ask Karpatkey DAO\
  \ for partial funding or a grant? Alternative, Karpatkey could grant a discount\
  \ on their services for the tools / services rendered by GnosisDAO via Zodiac.\n\
  \n**3\\. Zodiac spin-off**  \nFinally, can you specify the current plans for the\
  \ Zodiac spin out? For example,\n\n  * does it makes sense to have a Zodiac token?\
  \ (if yes, why (utility)?)\n  * will the funding for the Zodiac spin out come from\
  \ GnosisDAO, Gnosis Ltd or externals?\n  * etc.\n\n\n\n3 Likes\n\n[auryn_macmillan](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/auryn_macmillan)\

  \n> sorry to hear the Zodiac team leaving Gnosis this / next year.\n\nWe’re certainly\
  \ not planning to leaving the Gnosis ecosystem. But, similar to Safe, CoW, and Karpatkey,\
  \ there is a point where makes sense from the GnosisDAO’s perspective for Gnosis\
  \ Guild to become a distinct entity, rather than a team of contractors for Gnosis\
  \ Ltd / Employees of Gnosis GmbH. I definitely wouldn’t view it as a negative or\
  \ as if the GnosisDAO is losing anything in this scenario. It would be yet-another\
  \ instance of GnosisDAO successfully incubating a team, in which GnosisDAO would\
  \ obviously remain a key stakeholder.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a698b9/48.png)\
  \ Adam_tosz:\n\n> 1.000 GNO / employee compensation on top of a >$115k average compensation\
  \ appears too high\n\nThis is in-line with the compensation packages that we’ve\
  \ had from Gnosis over the past few years. However the Gnosis Guild team has taken\
  \ steps to both flatten and globally standardize our compensation structure, we’re\
  \ planning to publish some content on the rationale for this later in the year.\n\
  \n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a698b9/48.png) Adam_tosz:\n\

  \ year. Therefore I suggest to cap the GNO compensation at $100k p.a. on the date\
  \ of payout.\n\nThere is certainly a speculative aspect to this, but we think this\
  \ is an important part of the incentive alignment for our team; we should be incentivized\
  \ to contribute to the long-term success of the Gnosis ecosystem. Again, this is\
  \ similar to how Gnosis’ token allocations have functioned in the past. For what\
  \ it’s worth, we’ve also taken the down-side of this in the past. For example, the\
  \ value of GNO granted in Gnosis Guild’s previous proposal was significantly lower\
  \ when it was allocated to team members at the end of last year than when the proposal\
  \ was put through at the start of the year.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a698b9/48.png)\
  \ Adam_tosz:\n\n> The Zodiac team did great contributions to Karpatkey, leading\
  \ to several wins recently. However all the funding is coming from GnosisDAO. Doesn’t\
  \ it makes sense to ask Karpatkey DAO for partial funding or a grant? Alternative,\
  \ Karpatkey could grant a discount on their services for the tools / services rendered\
  \ by GnosisDAO via Zodiac.\n\nWe do have a very symbiotic relationship with Karpatkey,\
  \ primarily in service of the GnosisDAO, either directly to help make their treasury\
  \ management activities more efficient and more secure, or indirectly to help them\
  \ provide similar solutions for other clients. In both cases the GnosisDAO is a\
  \ benefactor as the GnosisDAO is a significant stakeholder in Karpatkey. Karpatkey’s\
  \ success is GnosisDAO’s success.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a698b9/48.png)\
  \ Adam_tosz:\n\n> Finally, can you specify the current plans for the Zodiac spin\
  \ out? For example,\n\nWe’re still working through this, but the current thinking\
  \ is that Zodiac is a standard and would likely benefit from a kind of dedicated\
  \ standards alliance to help steward and promote the standard, along with maintaining\
  \ credible neutrality between the different users of the standard.\n\nWe’ve been\
  \ working on a membership NFT token model for some time, this would be distributed\
  \ to individuals and organizations who have made significant contributions to the\
  \ DAO space and the Zodiac standard. Exactly what this is used to govern is a little\
  \ murky still, but it would likely be responsible for properties like the [zodiac.wiki](https://zodiac.wiki),\
  \ ratifying updates to the standard, and potentially curation of modules and other\
  \ tooling.\n\nWe don’t predict this organization having a great deal of overhead,\
  \ the funding for establishing this organisation is baked into this and last year’s\
  \ proposals.\n\n4 Likes\n\n[Adam_tosz](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Adam_tosz) February\

  \ auryn_macmillan:\n\n> we should be incentivized to contribute to the long-term\
  \ success of the Gnosis ecosystem\n\nCouldn’t agree more. However, a period of one\
  \ year is not long-term to me. My suggestion was to grant $100k GNO on the day of\
  \ payout, which may be worth $500k in 5-10 years (long-term).\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/user_avatar/forum.gnosis.io/auryn_macmillan/48/97_2.png)\
  \ auryn_macmillan:\n\n> In both cases the GnosisDAO is a benefactor as the GnosisDAO\
  \ is a significant stakeholder in Karpatkey. Karpatkey’s success is GnosisDAO’s\
  \ success.\n\nI think it is just a different perspective (financial vs. product\
  \ development). From a product development side it is great that we have a companion\
  \ that tries new tools and provides feedback. From the financial side, GnosisDAO\
  \ pays an independent Treasury Management team at a fair market price to mange its\
  \ funds. On top, Gnosis provides software and development work to Karpatkey (for\
  \ free). This may have been fine for the incubation phase but I think the Gnosis\
  \ Guild team has proven that it can ship great products and is now asking for an\
  \ extended contract. All I’m saying is that the team may want to ask its biggest\
  \ “customers” to also support its work financially to some extent. Just my two cents.\n\

  \ Adam_tosz:\n\n>   * Should GnosisDAO pay “junior” positions an above market average\
  \ salary + huge bonus? I don’t think so!\n> \n\n\nWorth noting that we don’t really\
  \ have anyone on the team that we would consider “junior”, which is why the averages\
  \ are skewed higher. Most of the team are what we’d refer to as either “senior”\
  \ or “staff” level. Everyone on the team is well beyond junior / entry-level in\
  \ their given roles.\n\nFor reference, here is a breakdown of our compensation levels.\n\
  \nLevel | Modifier | Compensation  \n---|---|---  \nJunior | -15% | $85k  \nBase\
  \ | 0% | $100k  \nStaff | +15% | $115k  \nSenior | +30% | $130k  \nLeadership |\
  \ +35% | $135k  \n  \nThis is currently uniform across all roles and locations,\
  \ which we recognize is different to how most teams approach compensation. We’ve\
  \ left open the possibility for compensation for different roles to diverge in the\
  \ future, but wanted an equitable starting point. We don’t believe that compensation\
  \ should differ based on location, especially given our entire team is remote.\n\

  \n> However, a period of one year is not long-term to me.\n\nAlong with the time\
  \ between when the grant is approved and when team members receive their allocation\
  \ (6-12 months), there is also a two-year cliff (from the recipient’s start date)\
  \ and one-year holding period (from the time of allocation), so it’s more like 1.5\
  \ to 3.5 years from the date of this grant application, depending on how long the\
  \ recipient has been a member of Gnosis / Gnosis Guild. This has proven to be sufficiently\
  \ long-term incentive alignment, along with being a fantastic retention mechanism,\
  \ for Gnosis / Gnosis Guild in the past.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a698b9/48.png)\
  \ Adam_tosz:\n\n> My suggestion was to grant $100k GNO on the day of payout,\n\n\
  Because of price uncertainty, GnosisDAO has typically shown a preference for allocating\
  \ a fixed number of tokens up-front, rather than promising a certain USD amount\
  \ at some point in future. It’s operationally much simpler, gives teams autonomy\
  \ over how they handle compensation and token allocations, and allows teams to use\
  \ the tokens productively in the mean time.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a698b9/48.png)\
  \ Adam_tosz:\n\n> All I’m saying is that the team may want to ask its biggest “customers”\

  \ srv:\n\n> or at least, tie part of the budget to the tangible progress the team\

  \ grant application, depending on how long the recipient has been a member of Gnosis\

  \ justified as a bonus (one year cliff, linear vesting over three years).\n\nAn\
  \ idea I would like to bring up is that the remaining 70% should be staked by GnosisDAO.\
  \ The staking rewards can then be paid out as a bonus to Gnosis Guild on a monthly\
  \ basis as long as they support the Gnosis Beacon Chain (~1700 GNO per year). In\
  \ my opinion, this would be a more strategic plan that can be reviewed by GnosisDAO\
  \ on a yearly basis.\n\n2 Likes\n\n[ernst](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/ernst) February\

  \nHey, I can weigh in on this: Yes, until the end of 2021, the team (both Ltd and\
  \ GmbH) received a rather large GNO incentive. At the time when the total was allocated,\
  \ GNO was worth significantly less and went up 10-20x in the meantime. We decided\
  \ to honor these allocations but overhauled the token plan for the subsequent year,\
  \ adjusting to much lower GNO numbers (since the token valuation had ballooned).\
  \ The highest token components we have had since are 500 GNO/ yr. A senior token\
  \ allocation is 300GNO, with many juniors ‘only’ receiving 50GNO/ yr.\n\n2 Likes\n\

  \ ernst:\n\n> adjusting to  \n>  much lower GNO numbers (since the token valuation\
  \ had ballooned)\n\nDefinitely agree that periodic adjustment is necessary given\
  \ the volatility of GNO. The GNO allocation in this proposal is an example of this.\n\
  \nOur [previous budget proposal](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-27-gnosis-guild-treasury-allocation-to-gnosis-ltd/3429)\
  \ included a GNO allocation targeted at $100k per team member (denominated in USD\
  \ rather than GNO, I wonder if keeping this denomination would have made a difference\
  \ to how this proposal has been perceived?), at the time of the proposal the GNO\
  \ price was hovering between $350 and $450. Our allocations from the previous year,\
  \ denominated in GNO, are in line with the levels you mentioned. However, by the\
  \ time team members received the allocations, the price had dropped significantly\
  \ below the target USD rate.\n\nGiven that this was a new budget proposal, it felt\
  \ natural to make that periodic adjustment to the amount of GNO to accommodate the\
  \ price movement and bring the GNO compensation back in line with the target.\n\n\

  \ ernst:\n\n> Auryn, can you talk about the adoption of Zodiac a bit?\n\nI’ll put\
  \ together some more thorough information on this and post it here some time next\
  \ week. But can talk about it briefly now.\n\nFirst thing worth mentioning is that\
  \ I think it’s important to disambiguate Gnosis Guild and Zodiac. Zodiac is a [standard\
  \ for composable tooling for programmable accounts](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5005),\
  \ and while Zodiac is a big part of what the Gnosis Guild team spends its time working\
  \ on, it’s certainly not the only thing. We also spend a considerable amount of\
  \ time working on other needs-driven development for the Gnosis DAO (things like\
  \ the GNO locking contract, the COW vesting contracts and interface, the safe token\
  \ allocation contracts, tooling, and interface, and various governance process updates\
  \ for the Gnosis DAO), along with other tooling (e.g. [ethersmultisend](https://github.com/gnosis/ethers-multisend/),\
  \ apps (e.g. [tabula.gg](https://tabula.gg), currently getting an update to make\
  \ it much more functional after taking on a bunch of feedback since launch), and\
  \ touchpoints (talks, workshops, essays, etc) for the broader DAO community.\n\n\
  ![](https://forum.gnosis.io/user_avatar/forum.gnosis.io/ernst/48/284_2.png) ernst:\n\
  \n> I would like to understand which DAOs (besides Gnosis) are using which modules\
  \ and how you expect these numbers to develop/ which measures you’re taking to make\
  \ that happen\n\nBeing a standard, I actually think that the more important adoption\
  \ measure is quantity and quality of the tooling/infrastructure/platforms that are\
  \ leveraging Zodiac, either by building on top of the Zodiac mods that we’ve built\
  \ or by building their own.\n\nI actually agree that this is still lagging behind\
  \ where we’d like it to be, it’s been more challenging and required more hands on\
  \ dev work in other people’s code-bases than we expected, but it perhaps gives more\
  \ insight to the balance of personnel.\n\nHere’s a short list of some of the projects\
  \ that have integrated/built, or are currently integrating/building, Zodiac tooling\
  \ into their product:\n\n  * Snapshot (SafeSnap, Reality and UMA module)\n  * DAOhaus\
  \ (Moloch safe minion)\n  * Railgun (upcoming) (super secret module)\n  * Moloch\
  \ v3 (Built as Zodiac mods around a safe)\n  * Tally (Open Zeppelin Governor Mod)\n\
  \  * UMA (zodiac module, similar to our Reality module)\n  * Tellor (zodiac module,\
  \ similar to our Reality module)\n  * SZNS (NFT product based around our Reality\
  \ module)\n  * DxDAO’s DxGov / DAVI (upcoming) (built as Zodiac modules around a\
  \ safe)\n  * Cardstack (metaguard)\n  * SekerDAO / Usul (build as Zodiac modules\
  \ around a safe)\n  * Bulla Banking (Zodiac module for accounting)\n\n\n\nTo answer\
  \ your initial question, we have somewhat limited insight into who is using Zodiac\
  \ modules and for what, currently. This is something we need to improve on. However,\
  \ it looks like there are currently about [170 Snapshot spaces using the reality\
  \ module](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P4N_17zWy_O3xXjAGyMHChOuYpTkXz86hmWgBFPljJ4/edit?usp=sharing).\
  \ Several appear to be tests, but some notable spaces in this list are 1Inch, Agave,\
  \ Dappradar, Deversifi, mStable Governance, Safe, ShapeShift, and Stakewise, and\
  \ of course Gnosis.\n\nThe Roles module has been critical in Karpatkey’s non-custodial\
  \ treasury management, allowing it to take to clients like ENS and Balancer, and\
  \ presumably with many more to come.\n\n![](https://forum.gnosis.io/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/a/a698b9/48.png)\

  \ there will not be further details available for a GNO holder to make any decisions\
  \ on the budget other than on what has been shared above.\n\nJust wanted to quickly\
  \ touch on this point from a previous reply. We’re not in a rush to push this through,\
  \ we very much want to take our time on this proposal to make sure it aligns with\
  \ stakeholder expectations. Everything in the proposal is most definitely still\
