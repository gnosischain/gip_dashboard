  \nThe proposal will fund the Gnosis Guild’s operations for one year. The Gnosis\
  \ Guild treasury allocation would continue to foster needs-driven development for\
  \ the GnosisDAO and of the Zodiac ecosystem at a total of $3,823,575 paid in 56%\
  \ DAI and 44% GNO for our contributor compensation plan, administered by Gnosis\
  \ Guild following the vesting schedule laid out in the Gnosis token plan.\n\n##\
  \  Abstract\n\nGnosis Guild is a society dedicated to interdependent software and\
  \ the growth of the Zodiac Standard. In 2022, Gnosis Guild completed a year of needs-driven\
  \ development for the GnosisDAO and continued to grow the Zodiac ecosystem. With\
  \ this proposal, Gnosis Guild requests funding to continue its development of GnosisDAO’s\
  \ infrastructure, expand the Zodiac collection of tools, and further establish Gnosis\
  \ Chain as an ideal ecosystem for DAOs. The budget allocation includes funds for\
  \ key personnel, operations, grants programs, and other areas as needed to sustain\
  \ this commitment.\n\n##  Motivation\n\nWe are a small, but growing, team rooted\
  \ in conviviality, mutualistic ownership, and experimentation. Since our last proposal,\
  \ a year ago, we have completed many projects focused in 4 main areas: supporting\
  \ GnosisDAO, developing novel treasury management tools, developing the Zodiac ecosystem,\
  \ and convivial software experiments.\n\nAn effective and productive DAO implicitly\
  \ spreads the technology on which it’s built; this is the core of our symbiotic\
  \ relationship with GnosisDAO, and by extension, Gnosis Chain. In these early days\
  \ of our organization, it is important to demonstrate the effectiveness of Zodiac\
  \ by supporting Gnosis’s efforts to promote decentralized infrastructure. In the\
  \ past year we have completed:\n\n  * [GnosisDAO SAFE Distribution Tooling](https://claim-safe.gnosis.io/)—a\
  \ system to transparently calculate, distribute, and claim the portion of SAFE tokens\
  \ vested to GNO holders.\n  * [GIP 28 & 44: Allow GNO holders to vote with invested/staked/locked\
  \ positions in Mainnet/GC](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-28-allow-gno-holders-to-vote-even-if-their-gno-are-invested-staked-locked-in-smart-contracts-in-different-protocols-networks/2357/18)—We\
  \ deployed a significant upgrade to the GnosisDAO’s governance structure, allowing\
  \ GNO, LGNO, and MGNO on Mainnet and Gnosis Chain to participate in voting.\n  *\
  \ [Reality Module Improvements](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-reality)—We\
  \ have made significant improvements to the Reality Module used for GnosisDAO’s\
  \ governance.\n  * [CowSwap Locking Contract](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/candidate-deployment-of-cow-vesting-contracts-for-those-who-locked-gno/4208)—A\
  \ GNO locking contract, for CoW Protocol, for calculating $COW that will be awarded\
  \ to GNO holders that lock their GNO\n\n\n\nGnosis has one of the most productive\
  \ DAO treasuries, due to Karpatkey’s skillful management. Our tooling plays a key\
  \ role in their day to day activities, and was a core component to Karpatkey winning\
  \ the bids to manage Balancer’s and ENS’s treasuries. By supporting the effective\
  \ management of Gnosis’s treasury, we help ensure the long term support of Gnosis\
  \ Chain. In the past year we have built:\n\n  * [Zodiac Roles Module](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles)\
  \ —The Roles Module enables enforced granular, role-based, permissions for attached\
  \ modules. In combination with the Pilot App, [Karpatkey has utilized these tools](https://medium.com/karpatkeydao/framework-for-an-active-dao-treasury-execution-a30b0b287bb8)\
  \ to securely manage treasury funds in a non-custodial way, and was a key factor\
  \ in their successful ENS treasury bid. Version 2 of the roles mod will allow for\
  \ even greater granularity and modularity.\n  * [Pilot ](https://pilot.gnosisguild.org/)Extension\
  \ — The Pilot Extension allows a treasury management team to build a batch of transactions,\
  \ simulate them and queue them as a transaction on any Safe, whether it is using\
  \ Zodiac modules or not.\n  * [Zodiac Siphon Module](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-siphon)—\
  \ This MEV friendly module allows any Safe to make funds transferable from a money\
  \ market into a debt position when undercollateralized. Karpatkey will use this\
  \ to service Maker debt requirements (once audit is complete) .\n\n\n\nThe Zodiac\
  \ ecosystem continues to grow, both culturally and in toolset. Deployed on Gnosis\
  \ Chain (and other EVM compatible chains), our collection of open source modules\
  \ sees regular contributions and use. Zodiac tooling combined with cheap and fast\
  \ transactions make Gnosis Chain the optimal place for DAOs. This year Zodiac has\
  \ expanded with these developments:\n\n  * [Zodiac Wiki](https://zodiac.wiki/index.php/ZODIAC.WIKI)\
  \ — This wiki is home to a shared library of reading materials, documentation, stories,\
  \ and a pattern language describing common problems and offering practical responses\
  \ for DAOs.\n  * [Zodiac Exit Mod and App](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-exit)\
  \ — This mod allows specified token holders to redeem a designated token for a portion\
  \ of a Safe’s fungible assets.\n  * Zodiac [Governor Mod](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-oz-governor)\
  \ — This makes Governor style DAOs Safe compatible, bringing the security and flexibility\
  \ of the Safe to the most popular on-chain governance method.\n  * [MolochDAO](https://daohaus.substack.com/p/6991f40b-3931-47ff-bea3-fa6f9c365135?s=r)s\
  \ can now control Safes— DAOHaus made their minion contracts Zodiac compatible.\n\
  \n\n\nWith this treasury allocation, Gnosis Guild will continue to carry out needs-driven\
  \ development for GnosisDAO’s infrastructure, executing on emergent GIPs and DAO\
  \ requirements as we have demonstrated the past year. Furthermore, we will continue\
  \ to serve Gnosis Chain’s DAO ecosystem growth by expanding the Zodiac collection\
  \ of tools and the Zodiac Wiki. We will also continue our partnership with Karpatkey\
  \ to serve GnosisDAO’s treasury management.\n\nIn 2023/2024, Gnosis Guild plans\
  \ to complete its spin out from Gnosis Ltd/Gnosis Services GmbH, forming a separate\
  \ entity based on mutualistic ownership and decentralized governance. The Gnosis\
  \ Guild entity will continue with the same team, objectives, and values, executing\
  \ on this GIP and our symbiotic relationship with GnosisDAO. This grant will be\
  \ made to Gnosis Ltd., and once the spin out is complete all grant assets will be\
  \ transferred to the Gnosis Guild entity.\n\n##  Specification\n\n[Gnosis Guild\
  \ Treasury Budget 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qyXGxCAk2GmiH4jz7tbtOIqNO6PBxghMQ3lsLZbMz7o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\
  \n##  Rationale\n\nGnosis Guild’s chief priority in 2023 remains needs-driven development\
  \ for the GnosisDAO and other DAOs within or engaged by the Gnosis ecosystem, along\
  \ with expanding the suite of composable DAO tooling and mechanisms available for\
  \ the Ethereum and Gnosis ecosystems. Keeping that in mind, the Gnosis Guild treasury\
  \ allocation budget has the following categories with their rationale described\
  \ below:\n\nCore Contributors: This budget category refers to the salaries and token\
  \ plan for 15 full-time contributors with the following roles\n\n  * 1 communications\
  \ and community role\n  * 1 operations role\n  * 1 business development role\n \
  \ * 12 engineering and product roles\n\n\n\nThe contributor incentivization plan\
  \ is intended to roughly double contributors’ salary, with an initial two-year cliff\
  \ followed by a rolling one-year holding period.\n\nStewards: This budget category\
  \ refers to the part-time payment for 2-4 “pod” roles to extend outreach, education,\
  \ and documentation of the Zodiac ecosystem, as well as assist with general community\
  \ and communications needs related to Gnosis Guild.\n\nBrand Design: This budget\
  \ category refers to contract-based payment for visual communications.\n\nGrants\
  \ Program: This budget category refers to the amount allocated to support initiatives\
  \ building on Zodiac and related DAO tooling.\n\nOps: This budget category refers\
  \ to operational costs related to administration, services, and subscriptions.\n\
  \nCultural Program: This budget category refers to what would traditionally be construed\
  \ as a marketing campaign. The cultural program is intended to further establish\
  \ Gnosis Guild’s reputation as a creative, editorial, and experimental team, while\
  \ seeking to meaningfully broaden discourse.\n\n16 Likes\n"
