  ## Executive Summary


  As some of you have seen on [X](https://x.com/beaconcha_in/status/1801223159334539776),
  beaconcha.in has launched a beta for the [v2 explorer](https://v2-beta-holesky.beaconcha.in/).
  It introduces several new features, including real-time monitoring of up to 100,000
  validators, the ability to group validators, and options to share custom dashboards.


  Our next steps are to rework the notification system, introduce an account dashboard
  for transactions, new APIs, new mobile App and more.


  Due to these upcoming changes, we stopped contributing to the v1 explorer codebase
  a few months ago. We expect to fully migrate to the v2 explorer sometime next year.
  Because of this, we would love to have Gnosischain on our v2 [open source](https://github.com/gobitfly/beaconchain)
  explorer.


  Voting in favor of this proposal will ensure a smooth transition from v1 to v2 for
  gnosischain.


  ## Specification


  One major criticism from the Gnosis community was the cap of 280 validators in the
  dashboard and app. This limit was due to technical constraints, not our unwillingness
  to increase it. Additionally, our old pricing did not differentiate between networks.


  We have listened to your feedback and propose the following for the v2 explorer:


  - Free users can monitor up to 20 validators, [which matches the average number
  for most Gnosis users](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IEPVvOE3T6B-a3NJVt3ws4LXXqc_h-QG-lw8wVoLgH8/edit#slide=id.g27a35603b14_0_1314)


  - Subscribed users can monitor up to 100,000 validators.


  - All features mentioned here: https://v2-beta-holesky.beaconcha.in/pricing will
  also be available for Gnosis.


  - Premium plans will offer a significantly higher validator limit for Gnosis compared
  to Ethereum, integrated within the existing pricing tiers.

  For example, if Pricing Tier “[Guppy](https://v2-beta-holesky.beaconcha.in/pricing)”
  supports 100 Ethereum validators, it will support a higher number of Gnosis validators,
  may support up to 500.

  This means users will only need one subscription to increase their limits on Ethereum
  and gnosis.


  The exact number for the Gnosis validator limit will be determined when we start
  integrating Gnosis.

  ## Timeline, Implementations and Deliverable


  Since [gnosischa.in ](http://gnosischa.in)is already up and running, there are no
  milestones necessary for v1. (See [GIP-74](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-74-should-gnosisdao-support-gnosischa-in-explorer-hosted-by-beaconcha-in/6228?u=butta))


  Voting in favor of this proposal will ensure a smooth transition from v1 to v2 for
  gnosischain and will cover the costs of v1-gnosischa.in for 1 year.'
