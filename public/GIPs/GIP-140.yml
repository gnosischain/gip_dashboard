title: 'Should GnosisDAO revamp Snapshot voting strategies '
body: "# Summary\nThis proposal replaces the current subgraph based GNO strategy with\
  \ a set of strategies that read state directly on-chain and from the beacon chain.\
  \ There are 3 main objectives to this proposal:\n- Add support for StakeWise tokens\
  \ (`sGNO` and `osGNO`)\n- Improve accuracy for validator balances\n- Remove the\
  \ external dependency on The Graph (everything is now handled by Snapshot)\n\n#\
  \ Introduction\nThe GnosisDAO Snapshot space is currently impacted by the GNO strategy,\
  \ which depends on Subgraph indexers. This has led to availability issues and inaccurate\
  \ voting powers because beacon chain state cannot be inferred from the execution\
  \ layer. We propose moving to on-chain data with a set of new strategies to reduce\
  \ inaccuracy in the voting power calculation.\n\nIn addition to delegations, voting\
  \ power will come from:\n- GNO balance (Gnosis Chain and Ethereum)\n- Locked GNO\
  \ (Gnosis Chain, Ethereum)\n- Validator balance (Gnosis Chain)\n- StakeWise’s `sGNO`\
  \ and `osGNO` (Gnosis Chain)\n\n# Specification\n\n1. Deprecate the subgraph-dependent\
  \ GNO strategy.\n2. Execution layer sources (Gnosis Chain / Ethereum)\n    - Use\
  \ the [contract-call strategy](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/score-api/tree/master/src/strategies/strategies/contract-call),\
  \ pointing to an aggregator contract on Gnosis Chain that returns each account’s\
  \ total GNO voting power across GNO, lGNO, sGNO, and osGNO. The contract was deployed\
  \ and verified at [0xE6C45c06e4C73e2aD58Aedf9bf83bCe1534b524a](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xE6C45c06e4C73e2aD58Aedf9bf83bCe1534b524a#code)\n\
  \    - Use the [contract-call strategy](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/score-api/tree/master/src/strategies/strategies/contract-call),\
  \ pointing to an aggregator contract on Ethereum that returns each account’s total\
  \ GNO voting power across GNO and lGNO. The contract was deployed and verified at\
  \ [0x1B2Eef4dd90cF1aF05967e0F246d4C0a19387B2A](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1B2Eef4dd90cF1aF05967e0F246d4C0a19387B2A#code).\n\
  3. Consensus layer\n    - Created a new [beacon-chain strategy](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/score-api/tree/master/src/strategies/strategies/beacon-chain)\
  \ to attribute staked GNO from the beacon chain by withdrawal address.\n4. Delegation\n\
  \    - Update the delegation strategy to support the 3 previously mentioned strategies.\n\
  \n# Implementation plan\nNow that [GIP-130](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-130-changes-to-gnosis-eth/10373/5)\
  \ passed, we can simply update the **snapshot** text field on **gnosis.eth** to\
  \ update the configuration of the Snapshot space. The plan is to set it to **ipfs://QmP6TVsWAcbxBNM229mgHXpxW7C9bTujk9LzDsiAWqDf7h**\
  \ with the following transaction:\n\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"to\": \"0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41\"\
  ,\n        \"operation\": \"0\",\n        \"value\": \"0\",\n        \"method\"\
  : \"setText(bytes32 node, string key, string value)\",\n        \"params\": [\n\
  \            \"0x77651e2c25d2b7b073d1068420770f96a43563e74df60e234b2433b2be66e29e\"\
  ,\n            \"snapshot\",\n            \"ipfs://QmP6TVsWAcbxBNM229mgHXpxW7C9bTujk9LzDsiAWqDf7h\"\
  \n        ]\n    }\n]\n```"
