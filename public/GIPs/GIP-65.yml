title: Should GnosisDAO fund Yubiai?
body: 'https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-65-should-gnosisdao-fund-yubiai/5901


  # Simple Summary


  Yubiai is a marketplace developed by ProofOfHumanity community members, where you
  can buy & sell services, digital products and physical ones using crypto, this will
  allow:


  1. Extreme low fees in commissions & gas in every transaction.

  2. People to have the possibility to use their crypto to buy and sell in a secure
  and transparent way.

  3. People offer their services, physical and digital products globally.


  To support the development of the Yubiai Dapp, we would like to ask the GnosisDAO
  for mentoring & funding in return for Yubiai Tokens & an increase in Gnosis chain
  adoption.


  ## Abstract


  Yubiai is a project born from the Proof of Humanity community that came together
  online to develop a web3 marketplace where you can buy everything with crypto. What
  was done so far?

  [Presentation

  At the core of Yubiai there are some protocols that give life to the platform:


  1. Gnosis Chain builds new market mechanisms for decentralized finance. Their three
  interoperable product lines allow you to securely create, trade, and hold digital
  assets on Ethereum at very cheap gas fees. Yubiai deploying on gnosis is a must,
  enjoy the p2p transactions of everything there is on our platform at the cheapest
  gas prices.

  2. ProofOfHumanity a sybil resistance protocol on the blockchain, a mechanism for
  social identity on ethereum.

  3. [Kleros](https://kleros.io/) Escrow, and the Dispute Resolver.

  4. Kleros Curate. “ Is this item following the marketplace rules?” By creating a
  list, defining guidelines and putting curation in the hands of the community you
  make a marketplace to operate accordingly to our own systems of rules.

  5. [TalentLayer](https://www.indie.talentlayer.org/#/) is the interoperability layer
  for work reputation. When you complete a job on Yubiai, you and the person you transacted
  with will give each other a review; growing your reputation over time. TalentLayer
  IDs allow freelancers on Yubiai to own your reputation as a soul-bound NFT. TalentLayer
  IDs are interoperable: your reputation can work on any integrated marketplaces.
  If you lose access to your wallet, your TalentLayer ID can be recovered to a new
  wallet via an emergency recovery process.


  To support the team, we are asking for funding from GnosisDAO over 250000 DAI in
  return for 25,000,000 YBI tokens transferred soon after the deal is done.


  ## Motivation


  1. Increase adoption of Gnosis Chain. This will benefit gnosis ecosystem and Yubiai
  users due to the low gas fees.

  2. Attract users and sellers to Yubiai.


  Our goal is to provide a platform where buyers & sellers meet to transact in a secure,
  cheap & fast way. We will build a DAO in order to have project participants be in
  control over the project.


  We believe that bringing together GnosisDAO and YubiaiDAO would be mutually beneficial
  to the community. By supporting the YubiaiDAO community in technical matters, such
  as [Gnosis Chain deployment](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xdE677961f2a802DF105d014B8D7042914bb780cf/contracts)
  and Zodiac integration, the launch of YubiaiDAO could be facilitated.


  To enable the YubiaiDAO launch team to keep developing pre-launch, we propose a
  token swap in which GnosisDAO would transfer $250,000 worth of DAI to support the
  project. In return, we will transfer 25,000,000 YBI tokens to GnosisDAO soon after
  the deal, out of a total supply of 1000M YBI tokens at launch.


  The majority of the funding will go towards the development of the Yubiai Marketplace
  and marketing.


  More information about YubiaiDAO can be found in a dedicated write-up at [Lite Paper
  ](https://scythe-yarn-631.notion.site/Links-f792b511b11943c4925778b3a0905eb1).


  ## Specification


  * The Yubiai Marketplace will enable $CirclesUBI as currency, beside eth, dai(on
  Gnosis chain).

  * GnosisDAO will invest $250,000 worth of DAI in return for 25,000,000 YBI tokens
  out of a supply of 1,000,000,000 at the time of launch.

  * Received funds will be managed within the DAO multisig at yubiai.eth.

  * The signers consist of core YubiaiDAO members. If interested, a representative
  from GnosisDAO can join the signatories.

  * yubiai.eth will hold the minter role for YBI tokens.

  * A portion of the revenues, including but not limited to transaction fees generated
  on the Yubiai Marketplace, will flow back to YubiaiDAO.

  * Deploy of the Yubiai Marketplace on Gnosis Chain.


  ## Rationale


  Yubiai tackles peer to peer transactions of services, physical & digital goods,
  NFTs using crypto as currency, we believe that this usecase hasn’t been developed
  enough (most projects focusing on financial applications) and that Gnosis Chain
  using a stablecoin as its native token is the perfect chain for ut. Others projects
  attempting to create marketplaces, do not have the protocols that we are leveraging
  in order to provide the best and safest UX as well as all the incentives that are
  in place, such as the lowest fees from each transaction, leveraging the Proof Of
  Humanity community and being able to get the most out of their offerings for the
  seller and get their needs met by the buyers. The marketplace business has huge
  adoption of the total crypto population.




  ## Implementation


  Once this GIP gets approved, the 250k USD worth in DAI requested for development
  and marketing will be sent to the Yubiai’s multisig, which will administer the funds:
  0x17d79CF96896c4d2aa4d4a19a2c8dD08DaFd163D. And Yubiai gnosis multisig will send
  25,000,000 $YBI tokens to GnosisDAO address.


  ## Tokenomics


  * User Incentives : 50%

  * Treasure/DEX Liquidity: 20%

  * Team: 15%

  * Advisors/Help: 2.5%

  * Marketing: 12.5%


  ## Funds Allocation Details


  * Team salaries


  150k DAI


  * Marketing


  100k DAI (focusing 50% on the weeks before and during the launch). The rest to maintain
  a stable {but less intensive} (marketing effort for the rest of the year). This
  rest would be locked and would be unlocked progressively on time.


  Total 250k DAI
