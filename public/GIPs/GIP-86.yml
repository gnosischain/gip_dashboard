title: Should the GnosisDAO commit to additional rETH usage in treasury operations?
body: 'Executive Summary


  Gnosis DAO / Chain has decentralization as its core ethos, focusing on a distributed
  validator set for the chain and an open DAO structure run by GNO holders. Despite
  this, our Treasury has nearly all of its staked ETH assets sitting with LIDO as
  stETH. Given the success of RocketPool Protocol in creating a massively decentralized
  validator set through rETH and RPL, this proposal recommends that Gnosis DAO commit
  to moving at least 50% of their stETH holdings to rETH holdings over time in order
  to support Ethereum decentralization and reduce single protocol and “bad actor”
  risk that comes from Lido’s limited node set (29 nodes vs Rocket Pool’s 2550 and
  growing nodes).

  Introduction


  As of last notice, the Gnosis Treasury (managed by Karpatkey) holds 64,124 wstETH
  (~$130mm) and 5,725 stETH (~$10mm), 712 rETH (~$1.4mm), and 18,622 ETH. Full report
  here: 20230424 - karpatkey’s Weekly Report on GnosisDAO Farms.pdf - Google Drive
  1 This concentrated holding of a centralized staking provider token is a risk to
  Gnosis DAO and against the DAO’s core ethos of decentralization. This GIP is intended
  to direct Karpatkey to move to reduce stETH dependency and introduce additional
  rETH into their DeFi strategies in order to reduce risk to the DAO and provide support
  to decentralized ethereum staking.

  Proposed Changes


  The Gnosis DAO will instruct Karpatkey to reduce stETH dependency and increase staked
  ETH diversity, but WILL NOT dictate how this is best accomplished. Karpatkey, once
  instructed, will move forward with whatever strategies are in the best interest
  of the DAO to reduce stETH exposure and provide additional usage of rETH / RocketPool'
