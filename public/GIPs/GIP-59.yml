title: Should GnosisDAO fund Circles UBI R&D work?
body: "#  GIP-59 : Should GnosisDAO fund Circles UBI R&D work?\n\n  * Let’s do this!!\
  \ Go Circles!\n  * Make no changes\n\n\n\n0 voters\n\n###  Simple Summary\n\nThis\
  \ proposal would fund the [Circles Coop eG](http://circles.coop) and the[ Bitsposessed](https://join.bitspossessed.org/)\
  \ developer collective to support the CirclesUBI team’s R&D costs for one and a\
  \ half years and expand operations. The following Circles UBI proposal would foster\
  \ the mass adoption of key Gnosis technologies like the Gnosis Safe via the establishment\
  \ of UBI Open Pilots as well as fostering internal collaboration between GnosisChain\
  \ dapps through the development of a Circles Web of Trust (WoT) GnosisSafe native\
  \ app and other tools at a total of USD - $3.571 Million, paid 45% in GNO and 55%\
  \ in DAI, administered by the Circles Coop eG.\n\n###  Abstract\n\nWith over 120,000\
  \ accounts deployed so far via the circles.garden interface, [CirclesUBI](http://joincircles.net)\
  \ has established itself as a power dapp within GnosisChain, developing, maintaining\
  \ and promoting basic income public good infrastructures built within programmable\
  \ accounts via Gnosis Safe technology. The present proposal seeks funding for the\
  \ team’s operations plus a UBI Open pilot funding program for 1.5 years, and includes\
  \ a detailed budget on how the team plans to allocate the requested funds of USD\
  \ - $ 3.571 Million equivalent. Through funding the present proposal, GnosisDAO\
  \ would establish clear alignment with its core values of funding public goods and\
  \ support the development and improvement of infrastructure critical to ensuring\
  \ the sustainable scalability of the GnosisDAO and GnosisChain ecosystem.\n\nSee\
  \ Phase 1 [here](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-fund-circles-ubi-r-d-work-a-web-of-trust-dapp-for-gnosis-safe-ubi-as-public-goods/4936).\n\
  \n###  Motivation\n\nCirclesUBI is a basic income system for communities built on\
  \ the GnosisChain. CirclesUBI was coined first by Martin Koeppelmann during the\
  \ early days of Ethereum, merging ancient traditions of mutual credit with the idea\
  \ of Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) into [a system of personal currencies](https://handbook.joincircles.net/docs/developers/whitepaper/).\
  \ Since CirclesUBI launched in Berlin in October 2020 it has gained significant\
  \ attention from individuals and communities world-wide, with over 120,000 successfully\
  \ deployed GnosisSafes to date. Beyond the ongoing [Berlin Open Pilot](https://joincircles.net/business/)\
  \ and the communities who use Circles around the world, there are new instances\
  \ of the application being developed around the world, including a campaign by Expedition\
  \ Grundeinkommen in Berlin that started from May 2022 (circles.pink). This proposal\
  \ will support the development of a world-wide Circles Movement DAO to serve these\
  \ as well as other emerging communities.\n\nTo ensure our mission to make Circles\
  \ a planetary movement towards bringing UBI into the world, the Circles Coop and\
  \ the Bitspossessed collective have successfully relaunched Circles in order to\
  \ have an issuance rate based on time so that communities world-wide can more easily\
  \ anchor Circles to their own Units of Account and start exchanging using CRC. You\
  \ can read more about the recent transition and its benefits [here](https://circlesubi.medium.com/the-revaluation-of-the-circles-system-c6eea70e767d?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------).\n\
  \nWith the goal to further increase uptake, Circles Coop and Bitspossessed are now\
  \ focused on creating a resilient payments infrastructure without single points\
  \ of failure (SPOFs). Based on the online [Circles Market](http://market.joincircles.net),\
  \ the team is currently designing the specification to develop an OpenAPI so that\
  \ people across the planet can use their existing preferred payment methods to co-pay\
  \ with their CRC currency.\n\nAfter the successful [merge of XDAI/Gnosis](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904),\
  \ we believe it’s time to deliver on the promises of “developing the Gnosis Chain\
  \ ecosystem and incentivize usage”. In order to have a more resilient and interdependent\
  \ ecosystem, the CirclesUBI team wants to bring mutual benefit to the different\
  \ dapps within GnosisChain via the development of a [Circles Web of Trust ](https://protocol.bgnm.de/essays/sarah-friend/)(WoT)\
  \ dapp within GnosisSafe. A native WoT GnosisSafe app would provide pathways for\
  \ interoperability and integration between dapps, DAOs, GnosisChain POS validators,\
  \ other WoT networks like [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/),\
  \ [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) and more, embedding trusted relationships\
  \ and token systems within a modular and integrative WoT for GnosisChain.\n\nCircles\
  \ UBI Coop approaches its mid-term development through establishing revenue-generating\
  \ income sources to cover cost of production and re-invest the overflow into R&D.\
  \ The CirclesUBI team will develop a Community Currency Exchange, a social DEX that\
  \ promotes community finance (Co-Fi) via CRC group currencies and other alt-coins\
  \ like our sister project [Trustlines](https://trustlines.network/) (recently [decided](https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0x13f2908cc42a1d21872ff284b1f71bedd452781c3daf124221e67b13511e6bd1)\
  \ to move to GnosisChain), where SMEs and COOPs and municipalities can issue their\
  \ own community currencies and sell it for digital assets and DAI stablecoin in\
  \ return for future promises to their own production, creating healthier relationships\
  \ between investors within the Gnosis ecosystem and community/business members in\
  \ the Circles network, new DAO structures and more. The Gnosis ecosystem can further\
  \ benefit from the uptake of GnosisSafe infrastructure via CirclesUBI to non-crypto\
  \ natives, with over 120,000 safes deployed as of mid-2022 on Gnosis Chain (source:\
  \ [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/tschubotz/Gnosis-Chain-Gnosis-Safe-Circles)).\n\
  \nIn short, the Circles Coop & the Bitspossessed have assembled an extremely well\
  \ positioned team to stress-test, develop, maintain and expand underlying Gnosis\
  \ core infrastructure and drive Gnosis technologies to mass adoption via the implementation\
  \ of UBI on a planetary scale, which we believe to be a paradigm shift in how society\
  \ is organised. Gnosis currently provides the backbone infrastructure for this transition\
  \ to take place and our mission is to improve it through everyday usage with a wide\
  \ range of people.\n\n###  Specification\n\nThe Circles Coop and the Bitspossessed\
  \ collective seek to increase the size of the teams to a total of 24 full-time positions,\
  \ which will be employed over the course of 12 - 18 months, in order to develop,\
  \ maintain and expand the described tools. Furthermore, the proposal includes funding\
  \ for a Circles international ambassador position leading the community work within\
  \ the Circles Movement DAO and transferring the Circles Coop’s Berlin pilot learnings,\
  \ best-practices and research tools to better implement other Circles hubs around\
  \ the world.\n\nThe total budget requested for the CirclesUBI team (USD - $ 1.948\
  \ Million in DAI, 55 %) and to equip the Circles Movement DAO via the development\
  \ of Open UBI Pilots (USD - $ 1.5 Million in GNO, 45 %) is USD - $ 3.571 Million.\
  \ The full budget details of the present CirclesUBI proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ORy9d2pw7IJoub05s5MuVLBD3kRyUqpQmJnMG1KhdR4/edit#gid=156254642).\n\
  \n###  Rationale\n\nThe [CirclesUBI technical roadmap](https://nubo.bitspossessed.org/s/jYMDYoA6ecZNFXw)\
  \ is public and was created by the [Bitspossessed](https://join.bitspossessed.org/),\
  \ the team that maintains and develops the CirclesUBI core codebase. Its chief priorities\
  \ for 2022 include improvements to the pathfinder algorithm, including hardening\
  \ transfer through transactions to improve the overall functionality and usability\
  \ of the Circles network, as well as developing a Circles Payment API & co-payment\
  \ functionality. For Q4 2022 and 2023, priorities lay on developing a general purpose\
  \ GnosisSafe Web of Trust (WoT) native app and tooling based on the Circles WoT\
  \ to encourage more on-chain collaboration and a Community Currency DEX. All of\
  \ this is to ensure that the already existing living communities using Circles can\
  \ have a better user-experience. In terms of promises to the GnosisDAO, we divide\
  \ these into two:\n\n####  1\\. Development of Gnosis Infrastructure & Public Goods:\n\
  \n  * Development of a GnosisSafe Web of Trust (WoT) native dapp & modular tooling\
  \ for the GnosisChain ecosystem: The Circles WoT provides a network of trusted peers\
  \ which can be used by different projects building on GnosisChain so that other\
  \ dapps can build on top of it using their own token network or connecting it with\
  \ other WoT networks (e.g. BrightID, Proof of Humanity, etc) and established more\
  \ aligned strategic pathways for collaboration. R&D will take place in the following\
  \ areas:\n\n    * Robust network reputation system for staking on GnosisChain via\
  \ the future Gnosis WoT & R&D on scaling GnosisChain through the Circles WoT and\
  \ projects like Dappnode.\n    * Trust relations between and within DAOs using GnosisSafes.\n\
  \    * Modular collaboration and integration between dapps in the GnosisChain ecosystem.\
  \ Think Proof of Humanity, Trustlines, BrightID, Circles and many more!\n    * Embed\
  \ real time economic trade data onto the blockchain to support the development of\
  \ more transparent, sustainable and trusted supply chains via the UBI pilots research.\n\
  \    * Pathfinder algorithm R&D - useful for other projects with native tokens to\
  \ do their own transactions using an integrated WoT dapp.\n    * Modular extensibility\
  \ of the transfer through methods.\n    * More non-market driven transactions, such\
  \ as recent Proof of Active Participation (POAP) efforts. * R&D into a future $WOT\
  \ token for the Web of Trust dapp for GNO token holders, similar to the $SAFE token\
  \ proposal.\n  * CirclesUBI Open Pilots: Leveraging Gnosis technology, the CirclesUBI\
  \ Open Pilots provide a strategic framework to go from basic income pilots to basic\
  \ income policy and basic income systems around the planet. The Circles Coop is\
  \ currently expanding the Berlin Open Pilot and plan to spread CirclesUBI more formally\
  \ into other regions as part of a Circles Movement, planning to expand the support\
  \ for open pilots by the end of 2023, where the [joincircles.net](http://joincircles.net)\
  \ will become a neutral platform for all projects using Circles and other wallet\
  \ instances, such as circles.pink (Expedition Grundeinkommen). The Circles Movement\
  \ DAO will work as a governance mechanism to allocate funds accordingly for the\
  \ implementation of these pilots to the communities that want to implement Circles\
  \ locally in a transparent way. Our go-to-market strategy is working with the B2B\
  \ sectors to increase productive capacity, develop infrastructure and go to key\
  \ stakeholders, such as established communities already using CRC, local municipalities\
  \ and regional governments interested in implementing basic income, in order to\
  \ create more ecological and transparent value chains. UBI is one of the main pillars\
  \ for the 21st century economy and a social ecologically just transition, especially\
  \ given the current context of supply chain disruptions and rising inflation. We\
  \ strongly believe GnosisChain and Gnosis technologies more generally provide a\
  \ strategic backbone for this transition to take place.\n\n  * Circles Payment API:\
  \ In order to have a scalable system and reach millions of people, we are focusing\
  \ on creating an open source payment API so that Circles can be used in a plug and\
  \ play basis, allowing people to co-pay with their UBI using existing payment infrastructures\
  \ and habits, such as debit cards, marketplaces and other payment applications.\n\
  \n\n\n\n####  2, Fulfilling the Promise of Investment Opportunities to GNO holders\n\
  \n  * Community Currency DEX: Based on Circles group currencies (currently being\
  \ developed by third party teams), a social DEX will create incentives for GNO holders\
  \ via investment opportunities in strategic future tokens emerging from the development\
  \ and deployment of the platform, as well as ROI from overflow investments in SMEs\
  \ and COOPs who sell their tokens to the communities that support them, liquidity-pool\
  \ provider incentives and more. To achieve this, we are exploring collaboration\
  \ with MakerDAO for integrations and researching deployment of e.g. the Juicebox\
  \ protocol on the GnosisChain. We are open for suggestions and potential synergies\
  \ to collaborate with existing DEX infrastructures (e.g. Honeyswap, 1hive, Uniswap,\
  \ Cowswap) within GnosisChain to design a specific-purpose social DEX that is directed\
  \ at the real economy.\n  * Indirect benefits for GNO holders: Due to further increasing\
  \ uptake of GnosisSafes and transactions being incentivized by Circles communities,\
  \ the revenue model of GnosisChain (e.g. transaction fees, staking rewards, etc.)\
  \ will in turn benefit all GNO token holders and those participating in the maintenance\
  \ and improvement of Gnosis Chain. We also expect benefits coming from Web of Trust\
  \ R&D.\n\n\n\nAll funds not spent will be at Circles Coop e.G. discretion.\n\nUnconditionally,\n\
