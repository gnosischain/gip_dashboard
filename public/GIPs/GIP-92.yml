title: Should Gnosis DAO spin-off karpatkey DAO and deploy the KPK Token?
body: "## Abstract\n\nkarpatkey has led the active DAO treasury management space after\
  \ becoming GnosisDAO’s treasury manager in GIP-20 and GIP-58. Following the tradition\
  \ of the sister projects CowDAO and SafeDAO, karpatkey will launch a DAO spin-off\
  \ and a governance token (KPK) from the GnosisDAO.\n\nkarpatkey will allocate 5%\
  \ of its airdrop to GnosisDAO, bringing GnosisDAO’s total stake in KPK to 7.5% of\
  \ the fully diluted supply.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWe’re ending the first three years\
  \ of karpatkey with many validated learnings and an exciting roadmap.\n\nOur 2022\
  \ and 2023 contributions to the GnosisDAO have been essential in developing the\
  \ Gnosis Chain and GnosisDAO’s treasury, improving the long-term value of GNO.\n\
  \nWe’ve become the leaders in active DAO treasury management and on-chain, non-custodial\
  \ asset management. karpatkey has established a strong network of DAO treasuries\
  \ with dedicated finance working groups for GnosisDAO, Balancer, ENS, CoW, Lido,\
  \ and Aave. We’ve also contributed to Uniswap, Spark/MakerDAO, Safe, and Arbitrum\
  \ by establishing delegate platforms and conducting paid research.\n\nkarpatkey\
  \ has been working in the most adversarial blockchain environment—where any vulnerability\
  \ is bound to be exploited—and has been exposed to multiple market volatility cycles.\
  \ We have resisted mostly because of our prudent, rigorous risk management approach\
  \ and long-term sustainable strategies.\n\nWe’ve executed +7000 DeFi interactions\
  \ with zero funds lost or hacked and actively protected our treasuries for +$900m.\
  \ We’ve improved the risk management infrastructure and tooling for our asset managers,\
  \ building the foundation for our alpha.\n\nOur past activity has ultimately generated\
  \ objective knowledge across the Ethereum ecosystem and DeFi protocols, which we’ve\
  \ used to contribute to the development of roadmaps and building and maintaining\
  \ structural tooling for non-custodial on-chain treasury and asset management, and\
  \ risk management infrastructure to secure institutional investment-grade funds.\n\
  \nHaving validated our market-fit, it’s time to take karpatkey to the next level.\n\
  \nLike COW DAO and Safe DAO, we intend to launch our DAO spinoff from the GnosisDAO\
  \ and issue our governance token.\n\n## Our Mission\n\n![805×788 73.7 KB](\n\nAs\
  \ traditional finance embraces digital assets and onboards assets on-chain, it is\
  \ imperative that DeFi protocols manage financial resources to maximise token holder\
  \ value and ensure the capital necessary to maintain a sound, resilient, and innovative\
  \ ecosystem. Everybody in our industry talks about banking the unbanked. However,\
  \ nobody talks about banking DeFi protocols.\n\nBanking DeFi is what karpatkey does.\
  \ We provide financial services to the leaders in each DeFi category, creating network\
  \ effects and robustness for their users, and the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.\n\n\
  ## Our Values\n\nWe’ve inherited Gnosis’ commitment to core values like decentralisation,\
  \ open-source collaboration, and ethically sound contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\
  \nThe following are the principles that guide the way we behave as a community and\
  \ help shape karpatkey’s decision-making process:\n\n  * **Simplicity** : We operate\
  \ in highly complex and unpredictable environments, so we think first principles\
  \ and execute at the right abstraction level to reach the shortest path to the solution.\n\
  \n  * **Focus** : We live by the Pareto Principle, so we pragmatically prioritise\
  \ tasks for maximum short-term output. This means we mindfully choose continuous\
  \ improvement over delayed perfection.\n\n  * **Altruism** : We cultivate long-lasting\
  \ and value-based relationships. This requires us to put in the effort without expecting\
  \ any short-term ROI. It involves shifting the focus from diminished self to collective\
  \ compounded returns.\n\n  * **Ownership** : We trust each other to do and be more,\
  \ encouraging and valuing personal initiative. We decentralise decision-making,\
  \ equipping team members with the information, agency, and confidence to make good\
  \ decisions for the organisation on their own.\n\n  * **Collaboration** : We care\
  \ for each other and explore new ways to continually grow our business through teamwork.\
  \ We learn from and challenge one another, sharpening existing skills and learning\
  \ new ones. We believe cognitive diversity generates better decisions.\n\n  * **Curiosity**\
  \ : Status quo is not an acceptable argument—we question concepts and processes\
  \ to improve. We understand that exploring the possibilities is the only path leading\
  \ to progress.\n\n  * **Adaptability** : We thrive in uncertain environments by\
  \ avoiding overfitting and adjusting to short, iterative execution cycles. We assess\
  \ and experiment rapidly, frequently, and economically, embracing every failure\
  \ as a learning opportunity.\n\n  * **Selflessness** : The community is above the\
  \ individual, so when debating internally, we leave our egos outside and let the\
  \ best idea win.\n\n  * **Rigour** : We acknowledge that our job has greater consequences,\
  \ so we perform at the highest level of quality, care, and professionalism.\n\n\n\
  \n\n# KPK Token\n\n## Utility & Supply\n\nThe goal of the KPK token is to align\
  \ the parties actively contributing to the delivery of karpatkey’s mission. KPK\
  \ will be a governance token to define karpatkey treasury parameters, budgets, OTC\
  \ deals, buybacks, and M&A deals.\n\n# How does Gnosisdao benefit from this proposal?\n\
  \nGNO token holders benefit from substantial ownership in karpatkey thanks to GnosisDAO’s\
  \ investment, a future airdrop proportional to the GIP-20 and GIP-58 expenditures,\
  \ and by being a leader in the DeFi treasury network we’re building.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\
  \nThe plans outlined in this proposal are for discussion purposes only and can be\
  \ subject to further changes. They may also need to be (re)structured to account\
  \ for legal, regulatory, or technical developments and governance considerations.\
  \ This document should not be construed as an offering of securities, taken as the\
  \ basis for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation to\
  \ engage in any transactions. You are solely responsible for your own investment\
  \ decisions and transactions.\n\nThe decision to spin out karpatkey and to launch\
  \ a KPK token lies solely with the Gnosis DAO. Consequently, this document only\
  \ describes the token launch process and its technical implementation as currently\
  \ envisaged.\n\n## *Update September 2024 - Modifications to GIP-92 phase-2\n\n\
  The initial proposal called for GnosisDAO to invest $5M in karpatkey through a $2.5M\
  \ stablecoin investment and a $2.5M GNO-KPK token swap.\n\nHowever, given the current\
  \ market conditions and the undervaluation of GNO, we propose replacing the token\
  \ swap with a $2.5M USDC investment. To reinforce our commitment to GNO, karpatkey\
  \ will allocate 10% of its total revenue over the next 12 months to purchasing GNO\
  \ in the open market, which we estimate will add +$2M GNO to our treasury. Purchases\
  \ will be made at our discretion and included in monthly reports to maintain transparency.\n\
  \nThe final GIP-92 structure consists of a $5M investment for 2.5% ownership at\
  \ a $200M valuation, with an additional 5% ownership through an airdrop, totalling\
  \ 7.5%. The total ownership of the Gnosisdao will amount to 10%.\n\n## *Update December\
  \ 2024 - Modifications to GIP-92 phase-2\n\n1- To address funding requirements for\
  \ Gnosis Chain and Gnosis Pay, we recommend that GnosisDAO prioritise funding these\
  \ projects, defer investing in karpatkey’s 1Q 2024 funding round, and participate\
  \ in future rounds. karpatkey’s GNO purchases will commence after future funding\
  \ rounds.\n\n2- GIP-92 proposes deploying KPK, establishing vesting plans for the\
  \ 2.5% KPK allocation from GIP-20, and creating additional vesting plans for 5%\
  \ ownership starting at TTE or one year after the execution of GIP-92, whichever\
  \ comes first.\n\n51 Likes\n\n**next page →**\n"
