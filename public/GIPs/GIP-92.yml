title: 'Should Gnosis DAO spin-off karpatkey DAO and deploy the KPK Token? '
body: 'Abstract

  karpatkey has led the active DAO treasury management space after becoming GnosisDAO’s
  treasury manager in GIP-20 98 and GIP-58 45. Following the tradition of the sister
  projects CowDAO 12 and SafeDAO 14, karpatkey will launch a DAO spin-off and a governance
  token (KPK), from the GnosisDAO.


  This proposal directs karpatkey to deploy the KPK token and allocate 5% of its airdrop
  to GnosisDAO, bringing GnosisDAO’s total stake in KPK to 7.5% of the fully diluted
  supply.


  Introduction

  karpatkey’s 2022 2, 2023 3, and 2024 contributions to the GnosisDAO have been essential
  in developing the Gnosis Chain and GnosisDAO’s treasury, improving GNO’s long-term
  value.


  karpatkey has become the leader in active DAO treasury management and on-chain,
  non-custodial asset management. karpatkey has established a strong network of DAO
  treasuries with dedicated finance working groups for GnosisDAO, Balancer, dYdX,
  ENS, CoW, Lido, and Aave. They’ve also contributed to Uniswap, Spark/MakerDAO, Safe,
  and Arbitrum by establishing delegate platforms and conducting paid research.


  karpatkey has been working in the most adversarial blockchain environment—where
  any vulnerability is bound to be exploited—and has been exposed to multiple market
  volatility cycles. They’ve persisted mostly because of a prudent, rigorous risk
  management approach and long-term sustainable strategies.


  karpatkey has executed +7000 DeFi interactions with zero funds lost or hacked and
  actively protected their treasuries for +$900m. They’ve improved the risk management
  infrastructure and tooling for their asset managers, building the foundation for
  their alpha.


  karpatkey’s past activity has ultimately generated objective knowledge across the
  Ethereum ecosystem and DeFi protocols, which they’ve used to contribute to the development
  of roadmaps and build and maintain structural tooling for non-custodial on-chain
  treasury, management, and risk management infrastructure to secure institutional
  investment-grade funds.


  Having validated their market-fit, it’s time to take karpatkey to the next level.


  Like COW DAO 12 and Safe DAO 14, they intend to launch their DAO spinoff from the
  GnosisDAO and issue a governance token.


  karpatkey’s Mission

  As traditional finance embraces digital assets 6 and onboards assets on-chain, it
  is imperative that DeFi protocols manage financial resources to maximise token holder
  value and ensure the capital necessary to maintain a sound, resilient, and innovative
  ecosystem. Everybody in our industry talks about banking the unbanked. However,
  nobody talks about banking DeFi protocols.


  Banking DeFi is what karpatkey does. They provide financial services to the leaders
  in each DeFi category, creating network effects and robustness for their users,
  and the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.


  karpatkey’s Values

  karpatkey has inherited Gnosis’ commitment to core values like decentralisation,
  open-source collaboration, and ethically sound contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem.


  The following are the principles that guide the way karpatkey behaves as a community
  member and shape karpatkey’s decision-making process:


  Simplicity: We operate in highly complex and unpredictable environments, so we think
  first principles and execute at the right abstraction level to reach the shortest
  path to the solution.

  Focus: We live by the Pareto Principle, so we pragmatically prioritise tasks for
  maximum short-term output. This means we mindfully choose continuous improvement
  over delayed perfection.

  Altruism: We cultivate long-lasting, value-based relationships. This requires us
  to put in the effort without expecting any short-term ROI. It involves shifting
  the focus from diminished self to collective compounded returns.

  Ownership: We trust each other to do and be more, encouraging and valuing personal
  initiative. We decentralise decision-making, equipping team members with the information,
  agency, and confidence to make good decisions for the organisation on their own.

  Collaboration: We care for each other and explore new ways to continually grow our
  business through teamwork. We learn from and challenge one another, sharpening existing
  skills and learning new ones. We believe cognitive diversity generates better decisions.

  Curiosity: Status quo is not an acceptable argument—we question concepts and processes
  to improve. We understand that exploring the possibilities is the only path leading
  to progress.

  Adaptability: We thrive in uncertain environments by avoiding overfitting and adjusting
  to short, iterative execution cycles. We assess and experiment rapidly, frequently,
  and economically, embracing every failure as a learning opportunity.

  Selflessness: The community is above the individual, so when debating internally,
  we leave our egos outside and let the best idea win.

  Rigour: We acknowledge that our job has greater consequences, so we perform at the
  highest level of quality, care, and professionalism.


  KPK Token


  Utility and Supply

  The goal of the KPK token is to align the parties actively contributing to the delivery
  of karpatkey’s mission. Tokenholders can vote on key decisions, such as treasury
  management, budget allocations, and strategic initiatives like buybacks or M&A activities,
  to ensure alignment with thier mission and long-term sustainability. The token’s
  utility is focused on facilitating community-driven decision-making and fostering
  an active, engaged ecosystem.


  How does GnosisDAO benefit from this proposal?

  GNO token holders benefit from substantial ownership in karpatkey thanks to GnosisDAO’s
  investment, a future airdrop proportional to the GIP-20 98 and GIP-58 45 expenditures,
  and by being a leader in the ecosystem within which they’re building their DeFi
  treasury network.


  Disclaimer

  The plans outlined in this proposal are for discussion purposes only and can be
  subject to further changes. They may also need to be (re)structured to account for
  legal, regulatory, or technical developments and governance considerations. This
  document should not be construed as an offering of securities, taken as the basis
  for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation to engage
  in any transactions. You are solely responsible for your own investment decisions
  and transactions.


  The decision to spin out karpatkey and to launch a KPK token lies solely with the
  GnosisDAO. Consequently, this document only describes the token launch process and
  its technical implementation as currently envisaged.


  The term “banking DeFi”, as used within karpatkey’s organisation’s proposals and
  materials, refers to decentralised finance (“DeFi”) protocols and platforms that
  offer services akin to traditional banking functions in a decentralised manner.
  However, it is crucial to note that in the context of Decentralised Finance, the
  term “banking” does not carry the same connotations, regulatory oversight, or institutional
  framework as it does in Traditional Finance.


  Users and stakeholders need to understand that “banking DeFi” platforms operate
  within the decentralised, permissionless, and often experimental nature of blockchain
  technology, which presents risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities, regulatory
  uncertainties, and market volatility.


  They encourage users to seek independent financial advice and to assess their risk
  tolerance before participating in any decentralised finance activities.


  Specification

  This proposal directs karpatkey to deploy the KPK token and allocate 5% of its airdrop
  to GnosisDAO, bringing GnosisDAO’s total stake in KPK to 7.5% of the fully diluted
  supply.


  Following the passing of this proposal:


  The KPK token will be deployed by the karpatkey team, thereby establishing vesting
  plans for the 2.5% KPK allocation from GIP-20 (2y, already vested) and creating
  additional vesting plans for the 5% KPK allocation to Gnosis DAO (1y cliff + 2y
  vesting), equal to the terms applicable to the participants in karpatkey’s 2024
  investment round.


  Additionally, and to address funding requirements, this proposal recommends that:


  GnosisDAO defers investment in karpatkey’s last funding round in exchange for prioritising
  the funding of Gnosis Chain and Gnosis Pay. The GnosisDAO should continue to participate
  in future rounds, and karpatkey’s GNO purchases should resume after future funding
  rounds.


  Proposal Update History


  Update September 2024 - Modifications to GIP-92 phase-2

  The initial proposal called for GnosisDAO to invest $5M in karpatkey through a $2.5M
  stablecoin investment and a $2.5M GNO-KPK token swap.


  However, given the current market conditions and the undervaluation of GNO, we propose
  replacing the token swap with a $2.5M USDC investment. To reinforce our commitment
  to GNO, karpatkey will allocate 10% of its total revenue over the next 12 months
  to purchasing GNO in the open market, which we estimate will add +$2M GNO to our
  treasury. Purchases will be made at our discretion and included in monthly reports
  to maintain transparency.


  The final GIP-92 structure consists of a $5M investment for 2.5% ownership at a
  $200M valuation, with an additional 5% ownership through an airdrop, totalling 7.5%.
  The total ownership of the Gnosisdao will amount to 10%.


  Update December 2024 - Modifications to GIP-92 phase-2

  To address funding requirements for Gnosis Chain and Gnosis Pay, we recommend that
  GnosisDAO prioritise funding these projects, defer investing in karpatkey’s 1Q 2024
  funding round, and participate in future rounds. karpatkey’s GNO purchases will
  commence after future funding rounds.

  GIP-92 proposes deploying KPK, establishing vesting plans for the 2.5% KPK allocation
  from GIP-20, and creating additional vesting plans for 5% ownership starting at
  TTE or one year after the execution of GIP-92, whichever comes first.


  Update February 2025 - Modifications to GIP-92 phase-2
