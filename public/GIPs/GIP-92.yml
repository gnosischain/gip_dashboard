title: Should Gnosis DAO spin-off karpatkey DAO and deploy the KPK Token?
body: "## karpatkey’s Mission\n\nAs traditional finance embraces digital assets and\
  \ onboards assets on-chain, it is imperative that DeFi protocols manage financial\
  \ resources to maximise token holder value and ensure the capital necessary to maintain\
  \ a sound, resilient, and innovative ecosystem. Everybody in our industry talks\
  \ about banking the unbanked. However, nobody talks about banking DeFi protocols.\n\
  \nBanking DeFi is what karpatkey does. They provide financial services to the leaders\
  \ in each DeFi category, creating network effects and robustness for their users,\
  \ and the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.\n\n## karpatkey’s Values\n\nkarpatkey has inherited\
  \ Gnosis’ commitment to core values like decentralisation, open-source collaboration,\
  \ and ethically sound contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe following\
  \ are the principles that guide the way karpatkey behaves as a community member\
  \ and shape karpatkey’s decision-making process:\n\n>   * Simplicity: We operate\
  \ in highly complex and unpredictable environments, so we think first principles\
  \ and execute at the right abstraction level to reach the shortest path to the solution.\n\
  >   * Focus: We live by the Pareto Principle, so we pragmatically prioritise tasks\
  \ for maximum short-term output. This means we mindfully choose continuous improvement\
  \ over delayed perfection.\n>   * Altruism: We cultivate long-lasting, value-based\
  \ relationships. This requires us to put in the effort without expecting any short-term\
  \ ROI. It involves shifting the focus from diminished self to collective compounded\
  \ returns.\n>   * Ownership: We trust each other to do and be more, encouraging\
  \ and valuing personal initiative. We decentralise decision-making, equipping team\
  \ members with the information, agency, and confidence to make good decisions for\
  \ the organisation on their own.\n>   * Collaboration: We care for each other and\
  \ explore new ways to continually grow our business through teamwork. We learn from\
  \ and challenge one another, sharpening existing skills and learning new ones. We\
  \ believe cognitive diversity generates better decisions.\n>   * Curiosity: Status\
  \ quo is not an acceptable argument—we question concepts and processes to improve.\
  \ We understand that exploring the possibilities is the only path leading to progress.\n\
  >   * Adaptability: We thrive in uncertain environments by avoiding overfitting\
  \ and adjusting to short, iterative execution cycles. We assess and experiment rapidly,\
  \ frequently, and economically, embracing every failure as a learning opportunity.\n\
  >   * Selflessness: The community is above the individual, so when debating internally,\
  \ we leave our egos outside and let the best idea win.\n>   * Rigour: We acknowledge\
  \ that our job has greater consequences, so we perform at the highest level of quality,\
  \ care, and professionalism.\n> \n\n\n## KPK Token\n\n### Utility and Supply\n\n\
  The goal of the KPK token is to align the parties actively contributing to the delivery\
  \ of karpatkey’s mission. Tokenholders can vote on key decisions, such as treasury\
  \ management, budget allocations, and strategic initiatives like buybacks or M&A\
  \ activities, to ensure alignment with thier mission and long-term sustainability.\
  \ The token’s utility is focused on facilitating community-driven decision-making\
  \ and fostering an active, engaged ecosystem.\n\n## How does GnosisDAO benefit from\
  \ this proposal?\n\nGNO token holders benefit from substantial ownership in karpatkey\
  \ thanks to GnosisDAO’s investment, a future airdrop proportional to the GIP-20\
  \ and GIP-58 expenditures, and by being a leader in the ecosystem within which they’re\
  \ building their DeFi treasury network.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe plans outlined in\
  \ this proposal are for discussion purposes only and can be subject to further changes.\
  \ They may also need to be (re)structured to account for legal, regulatory, or technical\
  \ developments and governance considerations. This document should not be construed\
  \ as an offering of securities, taken as the basis for making investment decisions,\
  \ nor be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions. You are solely\
  \ responsible for your own investment decisions and transactions.\n\nThe decision\
  \ to spin out karpatkey and to launch a KPK token lies solely with the GnosisDAO.\
  \ Consequently, this document only describes the token launch process and its technical\
  \ implementation as currently envisaged.\n\nThe term “banking DeFi”, as used within\
  \ karpatkey’s organisation’s proposals and materials, refers to decentralised finance\
  \ (“DeFi”) protocols and platforms that offer services akin to traditional banking\
  \ functions in a decentralised manner. However, it is crucial to note that in the\
  \ context of Decentralised Finance, the term “banking” does not carry the same connotations,\
  \ regulatory oversight, or institutional framework as it does in Traditional Finance.\n\
  \nUsers and stakeholders need to understand that “banking DeFi” platforms operate\
  \ within the decentralised, permissionless, and often experimental nature of blockchain\
  \ technology, which presents risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities, regulatory\
  \ uncertainties, and market volatility.\n\nThey encourage users to seek independent\
  \ financial advice and to assess their risk tolerance before participating in any\
  \ decentralised finance activities.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal directs\
  \ karpatkey to deploy the KPK token and allocate 5% of its airdrop to GnosisDAO,\
  \ bringing GnosisDAO’s total stake in KPK to 7.5% of the fully diluted supply.\n\
  \nFollowing the passing of this proposal:\n\n  * The KPK token will be deployed\
  \ by the karpatkey team, thereby establishing vesting plans for the 2.5% KPK allocation\
  \ from GIP-20 (2y, already vested) and creating additional vesting plans for the\
  \ 5% KPK allocation to Gnosis DAO (1y cliff + 2y vesting), equal to the terms applicable\
  \ to the participants in karpatkey’s 2024 investment round.\n\n\n\nAdditionally,\
  \ and to address funding requirements, this proposal recommends that:\n\n  * GnosisDAO\
  \ defers investment in karpatkey’s last funding round in exchange for prioritising\
  \ the funding of Gnosis Chain and Gnosis Pay. The GnosisDAO should continue to participate\
  \ in future rounds, and karpatkey’s GNO purchases should resume after future funding\
  \ rounds.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n# Proposal Update History\n\n## Update September 2024\
  \ - Modifications to GIP-92 phase-2\n\nThe initial proposal called for GnosisDAO\
  \ to invest $5M in karpatkey through a $2.5M stablecoin investment and a $2.5M GNO-KPK\
  \ token swap.\n\nHowever, given the current market conditions and the undervaluation\
  \ of GNO, we propose replacing the token swap with a $2.5M USDC investment. To reinforce\
  \ our commitment to GNO, karpatkey will allocate 10% of its total revenue over the\
  \ next 12 months to purchasing GNO in the open market, which we estimate will add\
  \ +$2M GNO to our treasury. Purchases will be made at our discretion and included\
  \ in monthly reports to maintain transparency.\n\nThe final GIP-92 structure consists\
  \ of a $5M investment for 2.5% ownership at a $200M valuation, with an additional\
  \ 5% ownership through an airdrop, totalling 7.5%. The total ownership of the Gnosisdao\
  \ will amount to 10%.\n\n## Update December 2024 - Modifications to GIP-92 phase-2\n\
  \n  1. To address funding requirements for Gnosis Chain and Gnosis Pay, we recommend\
  \ that GnosisDAO prioritise funding these projects, defer investing in karpatkey’s\
  \ 1Q 2024 funding round, and participate in future rounds. karpatkey’s GNO purchases\
  \ will commence after future funding rounds.\n  2. GIP-92 proposes deploying KPK,\
  \ establishing vesting plans for the 2.5% KPK allocation from GIP-20, and creating\
  \ additional vesting plans for 5% ownership starting at TTE or one year after the\
  \ execution of GIP-92, whichever comes first.\n\n\n\n## Update February 2025 - Modifications\
  \ to GIP-92 phase-2\n\n  1. Proposal Specification updated to reflect updates communicated\
  \ December 2024.\n  2. Disclaimer Language Updated.\n\n\n\n53 Likes\n\nGIP-121:\
