title: Should Gnosis DAO spin-off karpatkey DAO and deploy the KPK Token?
body: "## Abstract\n\nkarpatkey has led the active DAO treasury management space after\
  \ becoming GnosisDAO’s treasury manager in GIP-20 and GIP-58. Following the tradition\
  \ of the sister projects CowDAO and SafeDAO, karpatkey will launch a DAO spin-off\
  \ and a governance token (KPK) from the GnosisDAO.\n\nWe also put forward a $2.5\
  \ million investment proposal to GnosisDAO. In exchange for this investment, GnosisDAO\
  \ would receive 1.25% of KPK full supply, valued at $200 million. *A 1.25% GNO-KPK\
  \ token swap would also be arranged at the same $200 million valuation, with a 5-year\
  \ vesting period for the tokens.\n\nkarpatkey will allocate 5% of its airdrop to\
  \ GnosisDAO, bringing GnosisDAO’s total stake in KPK to 10% of the fully diluted\
  \ supply.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWe’re ending the first three years of karpatkey with\
  \ many validated learnings and an exciting roadmap.\n\nOur 2022 and 2023 contributions\
  \ to the GnosisDAO have been essential in developing the Gnosis Chain and GnosisDAO’s\
  \ treasury, improving the long-term value of GNO.\n\nWe’ve become the leaders in\
  \ active DAO treasury management and on-chain, non-custodial asset management. karpatkey\
  \ has established a strong network of DAO treasuries with dedicated finance working\
  \ groups for GnosisDAO, Balancer, ENS, CoW, Lido, and Aave. We’ve also contributed\
  \ to Uniswap, Spark/MakerDAO, Safe, and Arbitrum by establishing delegate platforms\
  \ and conducting paid research.\n\nkarpatkey has been working in the most adversarial\
  \ blockchain environment—where any vulnerability is bound to be exploited—and has\
  \ been exposed to multiple market volatility cycles. We have resisted mostly because\
  \ of our prudent, rigorous risk management approach and long-term sustainable strategies.\n\
  \nWe’ve executed +7000 DeFi interactions with zero funds lost or hacked and actively\
  \ protected our treasuries for +$900m. We’ve improved the risk management infrastructure\
  \ and tooling for our asset managers, building the foundation for our alpha.\n\n\
  Our past activity has ultimately generated objective knowledge across the Ethereum\
  \ ecosystem and DeFi protocols, which we’ve used to contribute to the development\
  \ of roadmaps and building and maintaining structural tooling for non-custodial\
  \ on-chain treasury and asset management, and risk management infrastructure to\
  \ secure institutional investment-grade funds.\n\nHaving validated our market-fit,\
  \ it’s time to take karpatkey to the next level.\n\nLike COW DAO and Safe DAO, we\
  \ intend to launch our DAO spinoff from the GnosisDAO and issue our governance token.\n\
  \n## Our Mission\n\n![805×788 73.7 KB](\n\nAs traditional finance embraces digital\
  \ assets and onboards assets on-chain, it is imperative that DeFi protocols manage\
  \ financial resources to maximise token holder value and ensure the capital necessary\
  \ to maintain a sound, resilient, and innovative ecosystem. Everybody in our industry\
  \ talks about banking the unbanked. However, nobody talks about banking DeFi protocols.\n\
  \nBanking DeFi is what karpatkey does. We provide financial services to the leaders\
  \ in each DeFi category, creating network effects and robustness for their users,\
  \ and the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.\n\n## Our Values\n\nWe’ve inherited Gnosis’\
  \ commitment to core values like decentralisation, open-source collaboration, and\
  \ ethically sound contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe following are\
  \ the principles that guide the way we behave as a community and help shape karpatkey’s\
  \ decision-making process:\n\n  * **Simplicity** : We operate in highly complex\
  \ and unpredictable environments, so we think first principles and execute at the\
  \ right abstraction level to reach the shortest path to the solution.\n\n  * **Focus**\
  \ : We live by the Pareto Principle, so we pragmatically prioritise tasks for maximum\
  \ short-term output. This means we mindfully choose continuous improvement over\
  \ delayed perfection.\n\n  * **Altruism** : We cultivate long-lasting and value-based\
  \ relationships. This requires us to put in the effort without expecting any short-term\
  \ ROI. It involves shifting the focus from diminished self to collective compounded\
  \ returns.\n\n  * **Ownership** : We trust each other to do and be more, encouraging\
  \ and valuing personal initiative. We decentralise decision-making, equipping team\
  \ members with the information, agency, and confidence to make good decisions for\
  \ the organisation on their own.\n\n  * **Collaboration** : We care for each other\
  \ and explore new ways to continually grow our business through teamwork. We learn\
  \ from and challenge one another, sharpening existing skills and learning new ones.\
  \ We believe cognitive diversity generates better decisions.\n\n  * **Curiosity**\
  \ : Status quo is not an acceptable argument—we question concepts and processes\
  \ to improve. We understand that exploring the possibilities is the only path leading\
  \ to progress.\n\n  * **Adaptability** : We thrive in uncertain environments by\
  \ avoiding overfitting and adjusting to short, iterative execution cycles. We assess\
  \ and experiment rapidly, frequently, and economically, embracing every failure\
  \ as a learning opportunity.\n\n  * **Selflessness** : The community is above the\
  \ individual, so when debating internally, we leave our egos outside and let the\
  \ best idea win.\n\n  * **Rigour** : We acknowledge that our job has greater consequences,\
  \ so we perform at the highest level of quality, care, and professionalism.\n\n\n\
  \n\n# KPK Token\n\n## Utility & Supply\n\nThe goal of the KPK token is to align\
  \ the parties actively contributing to the delivery of karpatkey’s mission. KPK\
  \ will be a governance token to define karpatkey treasury parameters, budgets, OTC\
  \ deals, buybacks, and M&A deals.\n\nThe full supply will be 1 million KPK and non-transferable\
  \ for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Distribution\n\n![imageimage976×504 35.5 KB](\
  \ \"image\")\n\n  * **Founders/Early Contributors** : Initial full-time contributors\
  \ who invested at a $20 million valuation.\n\n  * **GnosisDAO Early Investment**\
  \ : $1 million investment at a $50 million valuation in GIP-20.\n\n  * **Team**\
  \ : 37% of the total Team’s projection has already been allocated to team members\
  \ (currently under a vesting schedule), and the rest will be distributed to the\
  \ future team.\n\n  * **Future Fundraising** : Allocated to strategic investors.\n\
  \n  * **Airdrops** : Incentives used to boost the adoption of karpatkey and increase\
  \ TVL for our future funds.\n\n  * **Treasury Core Units** : Teams working with\
  \ our Finance Working Groups, not included in the Team’s budget.\n\n  * **Partners**\
  \ : Organisations contributing to our vision.\n\n  * **M &A allocation**:\n\n  \
  \  * Token swaps with our DeFi protocol treasuries;\n    * Equity or token swaps\
  \ for strategic projects building Risk Management tooling, Asset Management infrastructure,\
  \ and DeFi financial services; and\n    * Convertible Collateral to source DeFi\
  \ assets from treasuries for market-making and bootstrapping ETF-like products.\n\
  \  * **Treasury Reserve** : Used as collateral and liquidity for various purposes.\n\
  \n\n\n\n# How does Gnosisdao benefit from this proposal?\n\nGNO token holders benefit\
  \ from substantial ownership in karpatkey thanks to GnosisDAO’s investment, a future\
  \ airdrop proportional to the GIP-20 and GIP-58 expenditures, and by being a leader\
  \ in the DeFi treasury network we’re building.\n\n# GnosisDAO’s Investment and Token\
  \ Swap\n\nGnosisDAO acquired 2.5% of karpatkey in January 2022 with the passing\
  \ of GIP-20 at a $50 million valuation. We propose to increment +2.5% ownership\
  \ through:\n\n  * A $2.5 million investment for 1.25% ownership at a $200 million\
  \ valuation; and\n  * *A $2.5 million GNO-KPK token swap for 1.25% ownership at\
  \ a $200 million valuation, with a 5-year vesting period.\n\n\n\nGNO token holders\
  \ benefit from substantial ownership in karpatkey thanks to GnosisDAO’s investment,\
  \ a future airdrop proportional to the GIP-20 and GIP-58 expenditures, and by being\
  \ a leader in the DeFi treasury network we’re building.\n\nAdditionally, GnosisDAO\
  \ will be allocated 5% of KPK tokens through the karpatkey airdrop. Bringing GnosisDAO’s\
  \ total KPK stake to 10% of the fully diluted supply.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe plans\
  \ outlined in this proposal are for discussion purposes only and can be subject\
  \ to further changes. They may also need to be (re)structured to account for legal,\
  \ regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This\
  \ document should not be construed as an offering of securities, taken as the basis\
  \ for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation to engage\
  \ in any transactions. You are solely responsible for your own investment decisions\
  \ and transactions.\n\nThe decision to spin out karpatkey and to launch a KPK token\
  \ lies solely with the Gnosis DAO. Consequently, this document only describes the\
  \ token launch process and its technical implementation as currently envisaged.\n\
  \n## *Update September 2024 - Modifications to GIP-92 phase-2\n\nThe initial proposal\
  \ called for GnosisDAO to invest $5M in karpatkey through a $2.5M stablecoin investment\
  \ and a $2.5M GNO-KPK token swap.\n\nHowever, given the current market conditions\
  \ and the undervaluation of GNO, we propose replacing the token swap with a $2.5M\
  \ USDC investment. To reinforce our commitment to GNO, karpatkey will allocate 10%\
  \ of its total revenue over the next 12 months to purchasing GNO in the open market,\
  \ which we estimate will add +$2M GNO to our treasury. Purchases will be made at\
  \ our discretion and included in monthly reports to maintain transparency.\n\nThe\
  \ final GIP-92 structure consists of a $5M investment for 2.5% ownership at a $200M\
  \ valuation, with an additional 5% ownership through an airdrop, totalling 7.5%.\
  \ The total ownership of the Gnosisdao will amount to 10%.\n\n50 Likes\n\n**next\
