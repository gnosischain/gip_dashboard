  \ https://github.com/karpatkey\n    created: 2024-02-15\n    \n\n## Abstract\n\n\
  karpatkey has led the active DAO treasury management space after becoming GnosisDAO’s\
  \ treasury manager in [GIP-20](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-20-karpatkey-dao-treasury-management/2233)\
  \ and [GIP-58](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-58-karpatkey-dao-service-extension/5417).\
  \ Following the tradition of the sister projects [CowDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-13-phase-2-cowdao-and-cow-token/2735)\
  \ and [SafeDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-29-spin-off-safedao-and-launch-safe-token/3476),\
  \ karpatkey will launch a DAO spin-off and a governance token (KPK) from the GnosisDAO.\n\
  \nWe also put forward a $2.5 million investment proposal to GnosisDAO. In exchange\
  \ for this investment, GnosisDAO would receive 1.25% of KPK full supply, valued\
  \ at $200 million. A 1.25% GNO-KPK token swap would also be arranged at the same\
  \ $200 million valuation, with a 5-year vesting period for the tokens.\n\nkarpatkey\
  \ will allocate 5% of its airdrop to GnosisDAO, bringing GnosisDAO’s total stake\
  \ in KPK to 10% of the fully diluted supply.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWe’re ending the\
  \ first three years of karpatkey with many validated learnings and an exciting roadmap.\n\
  \nOur [2022](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431)\
  \ and [2023](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2023-year-in-review-for-gnosis/8016)\
  \ contributions to the GnosisDAO have been essential in developing the Gnosis Chain\
  \ and GnosisDAO’s treasury, improving the long-term value of GNO.\n\nWe’ve become\
  \ the leaders in active DAO treasury management and on-chain, non-custodial asset\
  \ management. karpatkey has established a strong network of DAO treasuries with\
  \ dedicated finance working groups for GnosisDAO, Balancer, ENS, CoW, Lido, and\
  \ Aave. We’ve also contributed to Uniswap, Spark/MakerDAO, Safe, and Arbitrum by\
  \ establishing delegate platforms and conducting paid research.\n\nkarpatkey has\
  \ been working in the most adversarial blockchain environment—where any vulnerability\
  \ is bound to be exploited—and has been exposed to multiple market volatility cycles.\
  \ We have resisted mostly because of our prudent, rigorous risk management approach\
  \ and long-term sustainable strategies.\n\nWe’ve executed +7000 DeFi interactions\
  \ with zero funds lost or hacked and actively protected our treasuries for +$900m.\
  \ We’ve improved the risk management infrastructure and tooling for our asset managers,\
  \ building the foundation for our alpha.\n\nOur past activity has ultimately generated\
  \ objective knowledge across the Ethereum ecosystem and DeFi protocols, which we’ve\
  \ used to contribute to the development of roadmaps and building and maintaining\
  \ [structural tooling](https://github.com/karpatkey) for non-custodial on-chain\
  \ treasury and asset management, and risk management infrastructure to secure institutional\
  \ investment-grade funds.\n\nHaving validated our market-fit, it’s time to take\
  \ karpatkey to the next level.\n\nLike [COW DAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-13-phase-2-cowdao-and-cow-token/2735)\
  \ and [Safe DAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-29-spin-off-safedao-and-launch-safe-token/3476),\
  \ we intend to launch our DAO spinoff from the GnosisDAO and issue our governance\
  \ token.\n\n## Our Mission\n\n[![](https://forum.gnosis.io/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/dacc95f79d75599b233b80f7d2f8126b47e1c37d_2_438x428.png)805×788\

  \nAs traditional finance [embraces digital assets](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023)\
  \ and [onboards assets](https://app.rwa.xyz) on-chain, it is imperative that DeFi\
  \ protocols manage financial resources to maximise token holder value and ensure\
  \ the capital necessary to maintain a sound, resilient, and innovative ecosystem.\
  \ Everybody in our industry talks about banking the unbanked. However, nobody talks\
  \ about banking DeFi protocols.\n\nBanking DeFi is what karpatkey does. We provide\
  \ financial services to the leaders in each DeFi category, creating network effects\
  \ and robustness for their users, and the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.\n\n## Our Values\n\
  \nWe’ve inherited Gnosis’ commitment to core values like decentralisation, open-source\
  \ collaboration, and ethically sound contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\
  The following are the principles that guide the way we behave as a community and\
  \ help shape karpatkey’s decision-making process:\n\n  * **Simplicity** : We operate\
  \ in highly complex and unpredictable environments, so we think first principles\
  \ and execute at the right abstraction level to reach the shortest path to the solution.\n\
  \n  * **Focus** : We live by the Pareto Principle, so we pragmatically prioritise\
  \ tasks for maximum short-term output. This means we mindfully choose continuous\
  \ improvement over delayed perfection.\n\n  * **Altruism** : We cultivate long-lasting\
  \ and value-based relationships. This requires us to put in the effort without expecting\
  \ any short-term ROI. It involves shifting the focus from diminished self to collective\
  \ compounded returns.\n\n  * **Ownership** : We trust each other to do and be more,\
  \ encouraging and valuing personal initiative. We decentralise decision-making,\
  \ equipping team members with the information, agency, and confidence to make good\
  \ decisions for the organisation on their own.\n\n  * **Collaboration** : We care\
  \ for each other and explore new ways to continually grow our business through teamwork.\
  \ We learn from and challenge one another, sharpening existing skills and learning\
  \ new ones. We believe cognitive diversity generates better decisions.\n\n  * **Curiosity**\
  \ : Status quo is not an acceptable argument—we question concepts and processes\
  \ to improve. We understand that exploring the possibilities is the only path leading\
  \ to progress.\n\n  * **Adaptability** : We thrive in uncertain environments by\
  \ avoiding overfitting and adjusting to short, iterative execution cycles. We assess\
  \ and experiment rapidly, frequently, and economically, embracing every failure\
  \ as a learning opportunity.\n\n  * **Selflessness** : The community is above the\
  \ individual, so when debating internally, we leave our egos outside and let the\
  \ best idea win.\n\n  * **Rigour** : We acknowledge that our job has greater consequences,\
  \ so we perform at the highest level of quality, care, and professionalism.\n\n\n\
  \n\n# KPK Token\n\n## Utility & Supply\n\nThe goal of the KPK token is to align\
  \ the parties actively contributing to the delivery of karpatkey’s mission. KPK\
  \ will be a governance token to define karpatkey treasury parameters, budgets, OTC\
  \ deals, buybacks, and M&A deals.\n\nThe full supply will be 1 million KPK and non-transferable\
  \ for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Distribution\n\n[![image](https://forum.gnosis.io/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/fae58c034a2ab75b51782801590e2a7bebad382f_2_690x356.png)image976×504\

  \ \"image\")\n\n  * **Founders/Early Contributors** : Initial full-time contributors\
  \ who invested at a $20 million valuation.\n\n  * **GnosisDAO Early Investment**\
  \ : $1 million investment at a $50 million valuation in [GIP-20](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-20-karpatkey-dao-treasury-management/2233).\n\
  \n  * **Team** : 37% of the total Team’s projection has already been allocated to\
  \ team members (currently under a vesting schedule), and the rest will be distributed\
  \ to the future team.\n\n  * **Future Fundraising** : Allocated to strategic investors.\n\
  \n  * **Airdrops** : Incentives used to boost the adoption of karpatkey and increase\
  \ TVL for our future funds.\n\n  * **Treasury Core Units** : Teams working with\
  \ our Finance Working Groups, not included in the Team’s budget.\n\n  * **Partners**\
  \ : Organisations contributing to our vision.\n\n  * **M &A allocation**:\n\n  \
  \  * Token swaps with our DeFi protocol treasuries;\n    * Equity or token swaps\
  \ for strategic projects building Risk Management tooling, Asset Management infrastructure,\
  \ and DeFi financial services; and\n    * Convertible Collateral to source DeFi\
  \ assets from treasuries for market-making and bootstrapping ETF-like products.\n\
  \  * **Treasury Reserve** : Used as collateral and liquidity for various purposes.\n\
  \n\n\n\n# How does Gnosisdao benefit from this proposal?\n\nGNO token holders benefit\
  \ from substantial ownership in karpatkey thanks to GnosisDAO’s investment, a future\
  \ airdrop proportional to the [GIP-20](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-20-karpatkey-dao-treasury-management/2233)\
  \ and [GIP-58](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-58-karpatkey-dao-service-extension/5417)\
  \ expenditures, and by being a leader in the DeFi treasury network we’re building.\n\
  \n# GnosisDAO’s Investment and Token Swap\n\nGnosisDAO acquired 2.5% of karpatkey\
  \ in January 2022 with the passing of [GIP-20](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-20-karpatkey-dao-treasury-management/2233)\
  \ at a $50 million valuation. We propose to increment +2.5% ownership through:\n\
  \n  * A $2.5 million investment for 1.25% ownership at a $200 million valuation;\
  \ and\n  * A $2.5 million GNO-KPK token swap for 1.25% ownership at a $200 million\
  \ valuation, with a 5-year vesting period.\n\n\n\nGNO token holders benefit from\
  \ substantial ownership in karpatkey thanks to GnosisDAO’s investment, a future\
  \ airdrop proportional to the [GIP-20](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-20-karpatkey-dao-treasury-management/2233)\
  \ and [GIP-58](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-58-karpatkey-dao-service-extension/5417)\
  \ expenditures, and by being a leader in the DeFi treasury network we’re building.\n\
  \nAdditionally, GnosisDAO will be allocated 5% of KPK tokens through the karpatkey\
  \ airdrop. Bringing GnosisDAO’s total KPK stake to 10% of the fully diluted supply.\n\
  \n## Disclaimer\n\nThe plans outlined in this proposal are for discussion purposes\
  \ only and can be subject to further changes. They may also need to be (re)structured\
  \ to account for legal, regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance\
  \ considerations. This document should not be construed as an offering of securities,\

  \ a KPK token lies solely with the Gnosis DAO. Consequently, this document only\
  \ describes the token launch process and its technical implementation as currently\
  \ envisaged.\n\n35 Likes\n\n[TripleD](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/TripleD) February\

  \ team to grow the karpatkey value, let other developers identify synergies and\
  \ hence increase a more vibrant ecosystem. Good products with good teams should\
  \ definitily spin-off after certain time for scaling.\n\n5 Likes\n\n[jackgale.eth](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/jackgale.eth)\

  \ February 16, 2024, 10:04am  4\n\nThe proposal doesn’t intend to offer tokens to\
  \ the general public. Instead, it is a spin-off from GnosisDAO, with governance\
  \ tokens allocated to past funders and contributors. As we indicate, there will\
  \ be fundraising in the future, but we expect this would be of a type that does\
  \ not fall under the MiCA rules (e.g. private sale, accredited investors).\n\n6\
