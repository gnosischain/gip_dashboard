title: Should Gnosis DAO support in a reimbursement plan to the Agave Community?
body: The motivation for this proposal is to make sure the Agave community and affected
  GC users are reimbursed at the end of this operation and that the community and
  protocol can continue the journey that started one year ago. We believe it is critical
  for the chain to make sure a significant amount of the long-term builders, supporters,
  and communities in the chain are restored on their losses as much as possible.
