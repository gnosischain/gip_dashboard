title: Should GnosisDAO establish Seldon Inc and appoint a Gnosis VPN Committee to
  support the Gnosis VPN project?
body: "## Summary\n\nIn GIP-98, Gnosis DAO approved initial research and development\
  \ for an anonymous VPN running on top of the HOPR mixnet, called Gnosis VPN. After\
  \ a successful proof of concept, in GIP-122, GnosisDAO approved further development\
  \ to bring the project to market over two years.\n\nHOPR is responsible for developing\
  \ the software for the first version of Gnosis VPN, including the Gnosis VPN client\
  \ itself and improvements to the HOPR mixnet and HOPR Session Protocol needed to\
  \ make Gnosis VPN work. However, the goal is for Gnosis VPN to be a standalone project\
  \ entirely separate from the underlying infrastructure and the HOPR team.\n\nTo\
  \ achieve this, Gnosis VPN already requires a legal entity to interact with various\
  \ vendors and service providers. It also needs a simple governance structure to\
  \ make decisions and instruct this entity.  \nThis proposal seeks approval to incorporate\
  \ a new legal entity and establish a delegated **Gnosis VPN** Committee to instruct\
  \ it. The proposed name will be Seldon Inc, subject to it being accepted by the\
  \ local authorities. Otherwise, alternative names given for the entity are Mallow\
  \ Inc and Maelcum Inc.\n\nThis proposal will explain the rationale for Seldon Inc,\
  \ its structure and initial operational budget, as well as the committee’s structure\
  \ and mandate.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWhy does Gnosis VPN need a dedicated entity?\
  \ We expect Gnosis VPN to play a fundamental role in achieving Gnosis’ goal of creating\
  \ the open internet. Anonymous, unblockable, and uncensorable internet access is\
  \ essential for sovereign digital identity. VPN services are also big business,\
  \ with an estimated annual market size of $130bn by 2030. Estimates for 2024 (made\
  \ in 2020) were all exceeded, so there’s a strong chance that this 2030 estimate\
  \ will prove conservative (sources: [[1]]( [[2]]( [[3]]( [[4]](\n\nIt was always\
  \ envisioned that Gnosis VPN would grow to be its own project, separate from HOPR\
  \ and Gnosis Ltd. Once Gnosis VPN is market ready, it will need to scale, and the\
  \ primary focus will shift from software development to business development. HOPR\
  \ is not necessarily best placed to provide this, and in the spirit of web3 it is\
  \ wise to separate the infrastructure layer from the services running on top of\
  \ it.\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, three legal options for stewarding a project\
  \ like Gnosis VPN:\n\n  * Use no incorporated entity at all\n  * Run Gnosis VPN\
  \ using an existing Gnosis entity\n  * Establish a new entity for Gnosis VPN  \n\
  The first may seem appealing for an anonymous web3 VPN powered by a mixnet, but\
  \ this is infeasible. The goal is to make Gnosis VPN accessible to everyone, which\
  \ requires a streamlined UX and ready availability of the Gnosis VPN software. On\
  \ mobile this means being listed in app stores, which will require an incorporated\
  \ entity to apply for and maintain the listing.\n\n\n\nIt is also not desirable\
  \ to subsume Gnosis VPN under an existing Gnosis entity, as Gnosis has a longstanding\
  \ tradition of decentralization on this front. Like all VPNs, Gnosis VPN is likely\
  \ to face some level of regulatory scrutiny, which also makes it unwise to lump\
  \ it together with other Gnosis entities.\n\n### Why now?\n\nSo Gnosis VPN needs\
  \ an entity. But why is an entity required now?\n\nAlthough the first market-ready\
  \ version of Gnosis VPN is not expected until the end of GIP-122 in 2026, Gnosis\
  \ VPN is already usable as a proof of concept and will see several increasingly\
  \ accessible versions throughout 2025 and 2026.  \nGnosis VPN exit nodes and other\
  \ infrastructure are currently operated by Gnosis Ltd, but this is only a temporary\
  \ solution, made feasible by the small number of users.\n\nThe PoC gives users access\
  \ to the wider internet via a bespoke type of HOPR node called an “exit node”. Users\
  \ select an exit node located in a country of their choice, and it is these nodes\
  \ which actually access the internet on the user’s behalf. These initial exit nodes\
  \ are currently hosted alongside other important Gnosis infrastructure. It would\
  \ be prudent for these nodes to be run by a different entity.\n\n### How Gnosis\
  \ VPN will provide IPs to users\n\nVPNs are essential but controversial services,\
  \ and often subject to takedown notices. To mitigate this risk, the plan is that\
  \ the entity controlling Gnosis VPN will lease IP subnet ranges as needed for its\
  \ exit nodes to be used. In the unlikely event that these IPs are blocked and more\
  \ IPs are needed, new ranges can be leased and the old ones abandoned. This is a\
  \ relatively inexpensive approach ($120 per month), and easy to register.\n\nWhile\
  \ we think takedown requests are unlikely, there is a chance that if cloud providers\
  \ take exception to Gnosis VPN it could have serious consequences for other services\
  \ managed by Gnosis Ltd. To avoid this risk, it makes sense for Gnosis VPN virtual\
  \ machines to be run under a different contract.\n\nAt the same time, the entity\
  \ in charge of Gnosis VPN already needs to interact with various vendors and service\
  \ providers. In addition to leasing the IP addresses and setting up a GCP contract,\
  \ Gnosis VPN should begin the process of getting its software listed in the Google\
  \ and Apple app stores. All of this requires a legal entity able to sign contracts\
  \ and make payments.\n\nAlthough we expect this entity to be minimally active during\
  \ GIP-122, establishing it already will lay the groundwork for future scaling. To\
  \ this end, we also propose setting up a lightweight governance structure, the Gnosis\
  \ VPN Committee, to take current decisions and begin the work of transitioning Gnosis\
  \ VPN to an independent project.\n\nThis would take the form of a three-person committee\
  \ able to give instructions to the board of Seldon Inc, with one member chosen by\
  \ each of Gnosis Ltd, Gnosis DAO and HOPR (“**Gnosis VPN Committee** ”). This structure\
  \ ensures accountability while preserving GnosisDAO governance at a strategic level.\n\
  \n### Incorporation and Role of Seldon Inc\n\nIn consultation with the Gnosis Ltd\
  \ legal team, an extensive jurisdictional analysis was conducted and Panama has\
  \ been selected as the most appropriate jurisdiction for incorporating Seldon Inc\
  \ for the following reasons:\n\n  * We are committed to user privacy and data protection.\
  \ Panama offers a regulatory environment that aligns with these principles—specifically,\
  \ there are no mandatory data retention laws applicable to VPN services. This enables\
  \ us to operate under a strict no-logs policy while remaining compliant with local\
  \ laws.\n  * Panama’s legal framework is not subject to intrusive international\
  \ data-sharing agreements or oversight from foreign jurisdictions. This independence\
  \ allows Gnosis VPN to offer a service where user confidentiality is central, and\
  \ where we are not legally obligated to collect, monitor, store, or share user information\
  \ or activity. Additionally, Panama’s non-intrusive regulatory approach ensures\
  \ that our infrastructure can operate with minimal risk of undue pressure or surveillance\
  \ demands, helping us deliver a secure, privacy-first VPN experience for all users.\n\
  \  * Incorporation and operational costs are low.\n  * Panama is the jurisdiction\
  \ of choice for other VPNs, such as industry-leading NordVPN.\n\n\n\n### Purpose\n\
  \n  * Execute the day-to-day operations of Gnosis VPN.\n  * Interface with vendors,\
  \ contributors, and external partners.  \nThis may seem vague, but we’ve been advised\
  \ that it is sound legal strategy for the purpose and bylaws to provide a wide and\
  \ flexible mandate that allows Seldon Inc to engage in a broad range of commercial\
  \ and operational activities. In practice, this would include the ability to develop,\
  \ distribute and commercialise technology products and services, manage financial\
  \ and banking operations, enter into contracts of all types, and hold or transact\
  \ in various forms of property, including fiat and crypto. We believe this aligns\
  \ with this GIP’s general goal of enabling effective execution and risk management.\n\
  \n\n\n### Ownership Structure\n\nSeldon Inc will be 100% owned by Gnosis DAO Operational\
  \ Foundation (Cayman). This structure ensures continued ownership by the Gnosis\
  \ DAO.\n\n### Operational Legal Costs\n\nEstablishing this entity in Panama will\
  \ incur the following legal costs:\n\n  * Incorporation: up to USD 5,110\n  * Annual:\
  \ up to USD 4,300  \nPayment can be made in crypto, subject to a 3% fee.\n\n\n\n\
  ### Governance\n\nThe entity would be required to have a board of three directors\
  \ appointed by a local agent in Panama. However, no control need be ceded to this\
  \ board: the bylaws of the entity would dictate that all decisions must be approved\
  \ by the Gnosis VPN Committee and the board must follow the instruction of the Gnosis\
  \ VPN committee.  \nMore formally, the following terms of reference (“**Terms of\
  \ Reference** ”) would govern the Gnosis VPN Committee:\n\n  * **Mandate** :\n \
  \ * Act as a liaison between Gnosis DAO, Gnosis Ltd, HOPR, and Seldon Inc.\n  *\
  \ Instruct Seldon Inc on all matters in relation to the Gnosis VPN project, including\
  \ but not limited to:\n  * i. execution of any contracts, partnership agreements,\
  \ letters, transactions, or any other form of agreement that Seldon Inc is required\
  \ to enter into; \n    * ii. approval of any financial related matters including\
  \ accounts, budgets, audit statements, or otherwise;\n    * iii. appointment and\
  \ removal of directors to the board of Seldon Inc; and\n    * iv. approval of any\
  \ other operational matters in relation to Seldon Inc\n\n\n\nInstruct Gnosis DAO\
  \ Operational Foundation (Cayman) in relation to its capacity as shareholder of\
  \ Seldon Inc on all matters of corporate and shareholder governance in respect of\
  \ Seldon Inc.  \nUpdate the Gnosis DAO on the activities of Seldon Inc and the Committee,\
  \ as appropriate and at least once a quarter.\n\n  * **Appointment and removal of\
  \ Committee Members** :\n\n    * Subject always to the overriding appointment and\
  \ removal rights of the GnosisDAO (as further outlined below), the committee shall\
  \ consist of [3] members, namely:\n  * one person appointed and removed by the HOPR\
  \ Association (the “**HOPR Appointee** ”). The first HOPR Appointee shall be Tino\
  \ Breddin.\n\n    * one person as appointed and removed by Gnosis Limited, who shall\
  \ be infrastructure / product focused (the “**Ltd Appointee** ”). The first Ltd\
  \ Appointee shall be Philippe Schomers\n    * one person as appointed and removed\
  \ by the Gnosis DAO (the “**DAO Appointee** ”). The DAO first appointee should be\
  \ selected by Gnosis DAO as part of the phase 1 deliberations for this proposal.\
  \ The selected appointee will then be named in the GIP which passes to phase 2.\
  \ We encourage the current DAO delegates to select one of their number for this\
  \ position.  \n(together the HOPR Appointee, Ltd Appointee, and the DAO Appointee\
  \ are the “**Committee Members** ”, and each a “**Committee Member** ”).  \nNone\
  \ of the Committee Members shall be entitled to remuneration in respect of their\
  \ appointment as a Committee Member.\n  * **Term**\n\n  * The Committee Members\
  \ shall be elected for a term of one (1) year.\n\n    * With regards to the HOPR\
  \ Appointee, HOPR Association may reappoint the currently appointed HOPR Appointee\
  \ for a further term of one (1) year, or it may appoint a new HOPR Appointee.\n\
  \    * With regards to the Ltd Appointee, Gnosis Ltd may reappoint the currently\
  \ appointed Ltd Appointee for a further term of one (1) year, or it may appoint\
  \ a new Ltd Appointee.\n    * With regards to the DAO Appointee, thirty (30) days\
  \ prior to the conclusion of each term, a re-election window will be opened. During\
  \ this period any member of the Gnosis DAO may nominate alternative candidates for\
  \ the position of the DAO Appointee by proposing an alternative candidate to the\
  \ community (via GIP or otherwise). \n      * If a new DAO Appointee is proposed,\
  \ the nomination shall be put to a poll vote of the GnosisDAO.\n      * The candidate\
  \ receiving the majority of votes in the GnosisDAO poll shall be appointed as the\
  \ DAO Appointee.\n      * If no alternative nominations are made for the position\
  \ of DAO Appointee, the current DAO Appointee shall automatically remain in position\
  \ for the subsequent one-year term.\n    * There is no limit to the number of consecutive\
  \ terms a Committee Member may serve.\n  * **Quorum**\n\n    * A quorum shall consist\
  \ of a majority of Committee Members (i.e., two out of three).\n    * No meeting\
  \ of the Gnosis VPN Committee shall proceed to business unless a quorum is present.\n\
  \    * Decisions shall be made by a simple majority vote of those present.\n   \
  \ * In the event of a tie, no Committee Member shall have a casting vote.\n  * **Variation\
  \ of the Terms of Reference**\n\n  * Notwithstanding any other term of the Terms\
  \ of Reference, Gnosis DAO can at any time by means of a Gnosis Improvement Proposal\
  \ (GIP):\n\n  * appoint and remove any Committee Member;\n\n    * amend or remove\
  \ the appointment rights of the HOPR Association, or Gnosis Ltd in respect of any\
  \ Committee Member;\n    * amend the maximum or minimum number of Committee Members;\n\
  \    * otherwise amend, remove, or replace the structure of the Gnosis VPN Committee,\
  \ or make any other amendment to the mandate conferred under these Terms of Reference.\n\
  \  * Unless explicitly provided herein, GnosisDAO does not have the authority to\
  \ retroactively cancel, reverse, or override specific operational decisions made\
  \ by the Gnosis VPN Committee or Seldon Inc.\n\n\n\n\n### Expected Committee Actions\n\
  \nIt’s impossible to fully explicate all actions which the Gnosis VPN Committee\
  \ might need to take, but at least for the duration of GIP-122 the Gnosis VPN Committee\
  \ is expected to primarily operate in a communication and approval role, by taking\
  \ the following actions:\n\n  * Instruct the Board of Seldon Inc as needed to establish\
  \ the necessary contracts for Gnosis VPN to operate (cloud computing platforms,\
  \ leasing IP subnet, app store listings, etc.).\n  * Respond in a timely fashion\
  \ to any developments related to these contracts.\n  * Assess and report on the\
  \ development milestones laid out in GIP-122.\n  * Interface with the Gnosis DAO\
  \ community to provide transparency.\n  * Post updates to the Gnosis DAO forum on\
  \ at least a quarterly basis.\n  * Ensure separation of concerns with HOPR while\
  \ maintaining compatibility where relevant.  \nThe quorum rules explained above\
  \ mean that two out of three Committee Members are able to call a meeting of the\
  \ Gnosis VPN Committee, but if they disagree on a decision, the only way to break\
  \ the tie is to reconvene with the third member present. This feels like the correct\
  \ balance between remaining dynamic while maintaining checks and balances.\n\n\n\
  \nAs we move out of GIP-122, we expect this governance structure to evolve to see\
  \ Seldon Inc taking a more executive role in the further development of Gnosis VPN.\
  \ Although this may end up looking very different to the current structure, we think\
  \ it’s wise to lay the foundations of this now, with a plan to further develop this\
  \ with the coordination of Gnosis DAO and the Gnosis VPN Committee in 2026.\n\n\
  ### Budget\n\nIn addition to the legal costs outlined above, Seldon Inc requires\
  \ a modest operational budget, mostly earmarked for devops and infrastructure costs.\
  \ Current estimates are for 14 virtual machines, with a range of specifications,\
  \ to handle gnosisvpn-js and exit nodes in staging and production. A 20% buffer\
  \ is included in case specifications change, with any further increase requiring\
  \ a request to the DAO from the Gnosis VPN Committee. The budget below includes\
  \ all projected costs, including the monthly directors’ fee but not the one-off\
  \ incorporation fee (to be confirmed, up to $5,110)\n\nNote that Seldon Inc is also\
  \ expected to earn revenue via its exit nodes, although the amounts will depend\
  \ on user numbers and traffic. If the exit nodes are also used as relay nodes in\
  \ the HOPR mixnet, they will earn HOPR tokens for relaying, as well as the cover\
  \ traffic which is distributed to all eligible HOPR nodes.\n\nItem | Description\
  \ | USD / month  \n---|---|---  \nCloud Computing | 14 virtual machines | 1,950\
  \  \nNetworking | ~10% of infra costs | 195  \nSupport | ~20% of infra costs | 390\
  \  \nSeldon Admin | Panamanian Director Fees | 360  \nIP Leasing | /24 IP range\
  \ subnet | 120  \nGoogle Workspace | Business Starter (5 users @ $8/mo) | 40  \n\
  **Buffer** | 20% costs buffer | **611**  \n**Monthly Total (Pre-Tax)** |  | **3,666**\
  \  \nTax | VAT @ 21% | 770  \n**Monthly Total (Post-Tax)** |  | **4,436**  \n**Annual\
  \ Total (Post-Tax) |  | $53,232**  \n  \n### Support from other services within\
  \ the Gnosis Ecosystem\n\nAlthough Gnosis VPN is conceived as an independent project,\
  \ it will naturally receive support from elsewhere in the Gnosis ecosystem. HOPR\
  \ will provide the largest input here, particularly during the two years of GIP-122,\
  \ being responsible for technical product development of the Gnosis VPN exit application\
  \ and client apps as well as the underlying HOPR protocol and client apps.\n\nHowever,\
  \ Gnosis VPN will require other support and assets, legal, community and frontend\
  \ support, as well as tokens (HOPR tokens and xDAI) to run its nodes. These token\
  \ amounts are modest, but do need to be sourced from somewhere.\n\nThe nature and\
  \ source of this support will ultimately be up to the committee to decide, but the\
  \ following is a speculative list of what Gnosis VPN might require and where it\
  \ might get it from:\n\nOther services / assets | Provided by  \n---|---  \nSoftware\
  \ development | HOPR Association  \nSoftware deployment | Gnosis Ltd  \nRPC provision\
  \ | Gnosis Ltd  \nHOPR token | DAO  \nxDAI token | DAO  \nLegal support | Gnosis\
  \ Ltd  \nCommunity support | Gnosis Ltd  \nDesign, frontend, website deployment\
  \ | Gnosis Ltd  \nGnosis VPN level 2 support | HOPR Association  \n  \nNone of these\
  \ are currently expected to incur any costs, although in future this might change.\n\
  \n## Conclusion\n\nApproving this proposal will enable GnosisDAO to efficiently\
  \ scale Gnosis VPN with appropriate legal and operational infrastructure, while\
  \ maintaining GnosisDAO oversight and alignment with the broader Gnosis ecosystem.\
  \ While we don’t expect the entity or committee to take many actions in the first\
  \ 12 months, we think it’s important to lay the groundwork well in advance to give\
  \ Gnosis VPN the best chance to thrive.\n\n4 Likes\n"
