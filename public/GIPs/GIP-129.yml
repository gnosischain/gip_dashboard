  \  \n    GIP: #129\n    title: Should GnosisDAO establish Seldon Inc and appoint\
  \ a Gnosis VPN Committee to support the Gnosis VPN project?\n    author: Sebastian\
  \ Bürgel on behalf of HOPR Association\n    status: phase-2\n    type: funding\n\
  \    created: 2025-07-23\n    \n\n## Summary\n\nIn GIP-98, Gnosis DAO approved initial\
  \ research and development for an anonymous VPN running on top of the HOPR mixnet,\
  \ called Gnosis VPN. After a successful proof of concept, in GIP-122, GnosisDAO\
  \ approved further development to bring the project to market over two years.\n\n\
  HOPR is responsible for developing the software for the first version of Gnosis\
  \ VPN, including the Gnosis VPN client itself and improvements to the HOPR mixnet\
  \ and HOPR Session Protocol needed to make Gnosis VPN work. However, the goal is\
  \ for Gnosis VPN to be a standalone project entirely separate from the underlying\
  \ infrastructure and the HOPR team.\n\nTo achieve this, Gnosis VPN already requires\
  \ a legal entity to interact with various vendors and service providers. It also\
  \ needs a simple governance structure to make decisions and instruct this entity.\
  \  \nThis proposal seeks approval to incorporate a new legal entity and establish\
  \ a delegated **Gnosis VPN** Committee to instruct it. The proposed name will be\
  \ Seldon Inc, subject to it being accepted by the local authorities. Otherwise,\
  \ alternative names given for the entity are Mallow Inc and Maelcum Inc.\n\nThis\
  \ proposal will explain the rationale for Seldon Inc, its structure and initial\
  \ operational budget, as well as the committee’s structure and mandate.\n\n## Motivation\n\
  \nWhy does Gnosis VPN need a dedicated entity? We expect Gnosis VPN to play a fundamental\
  \ role in achieving Gnosis’ goal of creating the open internet. Anonymous, unblockable,\
  \ and uncensorable internet access is essential for sovereign digital identity.\
  \ VPN services are also big business, with an estimated annual market size of $130bn\
  \ by 2030. Estimates for 2024 (made in 2020) were all exceeded, so there’s a strong\
  \ chance that this 2030 estimate will prove conservative (sources: [[1]]( [[2]](\
  \ [[3]]( [[4]](\n\nIt was always envisioned that Gnosis VPN would grow to be its\
  \ own project, separate from HOPR and Gnosis Ltd. Once Gnosis VPN is market ready,\
  \ it will need to scale, and the primary focus will shift from software development\
  \ to business development. HOPR is not necessarily best placed to provide this,\
  \ and in the spirit of web3 it is wise to separate the infrastructure layer from\
  \ the services running on top of it.\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, three legal\
  \ options for stewarding a project like Gnosis VPN:\n\n  * Use no incorporated entity\
  \ at all\n  * Run Gnosis VPN using an existing Gnosis entity\n  * Establish a new\
  \ entity for Gnosis VPN\n\n\n\nThe first may seem appealing for an anonymous web3\
  \ VPN powered by a mixnet, but this is infeasible. The goal is to make Gnosis VPN\
  \ accessible to everyone, which requires a streamlined UX and ready availability\
  \ of the Gnosis VPN software. On mobile this means being listed in app stores, which\
  \ will require an incorporated entity to apply for and maintain the listing.\n\n\
  It is also not desirable to subsume Gnosis VPN under an existing Gnosis entity,\
  \ as Gnosis has a longstanding tradition of decentralization on this front. Like\
  \ all VPNs, Gnosis VPN is likely to face some level of regulatory scrutiny, which\
  \ also makes it unwise to lump it together with other Gnosis entities.\n\n### Why\
  \ now?\n\nSo Gnosis VPN needs an entity. But why is an entity required now?\n\n\
  Although the first market-ready version of Gnosis VPN is not expected until the\
  \ end of GIP-122 in 2026, Gnosis VPN is already usable as a proof of concept and\
  \ will see several increasingly accessible versions throughout 2025 and 2026.  \n\
  Gnosis VPN exit nodes and other infrastructure are currently operated by Gnosis\
  \ Ltd, but this is only a temporary solution, made feasible by the small number\
  \ of users.\n\nThe PoC gives users access to the wider internet via a bespoke type\
  \ of HOPR node called an “exit node”. Users select an exit node located in a country\
  \ of their choice, and it is these nodes which actually access the internet on the\
  \ user’s behalf. These initial exit nodes are currently hosted alongside other important\
  \ Gnosis infrastructure. It would be prudent for these nodes to be run by a different\
  \ entity.\n\n### How Gnosis VPN will provide IPs to users\n\nVPNs are essential\
  \ but controversial services, and often subject to takedown notices. To mitigate\
  \ this risk, the plan is that the entity controlling Gnosis VPN will lease IP subnet\
  \ ranges as needed for its exit nodes to be used. In the unlikely event that these\
  \ IPs are blocked and more IPs are needed, new ranges can be leased and the old\
  \ ones abandoned. This is a relatively inexpensive approach ($120 per month), and\
  \ easy to register.\n\nWhile we think takedown requests are unlikely, there is a\
  \ chance that if cloud providers take exception to Gnosis VPN it could have serious\
  \ consequences for other services managed by Gnosis Ltd. To avoid this risk, it\
  \ makes sense for Gnosis VPN virtual machines to be run under a different contract.\n\
  \nAt the same time, the entity in charge of Gnosis VPN already needs to interact\
  \ with various vendors and service providers. In addition to leasing the IP addresses\
  \ and setting up a GCP contract, Gnosis VPN should begin the process of getting\
  \ its software listed in the Google and Apple app stores. All of this requires a\
  \ legal entity able to sign contracts and make payments.\n\nAlthough we expect this\
  \ entity to be minimally active during GIP-122, establishing it already will lay\
  \ the groundwork for future scaling. To this end, we also propose setting up a lightweight\
  \ governance structure, the Gnosis VPN Committee, to take current decisions and\
  \ begin the work of transitioning Gnosis VPN to an independent project.\n\nThis\
  \ would take the form of a three-person committee able to give instructions to the\
  \ board of Seldon Inc, with one member chosen by each of Gnosis Ltd, Gnosis DAO\
  \ and HOPR (“**Gnosis VPN Committee** ”). This structure ensures accountability\
  \ while preserving GnosisDAO governance at a strategic level.\n\n### Incorporation\
  \ and Role of Seldon Inc\n\nIn consultation with the Gnosis Ltd legal team, an extensive\
  \ jurisdictional analysis was conducted and Panama has been selected as the most\
  \ appropriate jurisdiction for incorporating Seldon Inc for the following reasons:\n\
  \n  * We are committed to user privacy and data protection. Panama offers a regulatory\
  \ environment that aligns with these principles—specifically, there are no mandatory\
  \ data retention laws applicable to VPN services. This enables us to operate under\
  \ a strict no-logs policy while remaining compliant with local laws.\n  * Panama’s\
  \ legal framework is not subject to intrusive international data-sharing agreements\
  \ or oversight from foreign jurisdictions. This independence allows Gnosis VPN to\
  \ offer a service where user confidentiality is central, and where we are not legally\
  \ obligated to collect, monitor, store, or share user information or activity. Additionally,\
  \ Panama’s non-intrusive regulatory approach ensures that our infrastructure can\
  \ operate with minimal risk of undue pressure or surveillance demands, helping us\
  \ deliver a secure, privacy-first VPN experience for all users.\n  * Incorporation\
  \ and operational costs are low.\n  * Panama is the jurisdiction of choice for other\
  \ VPNs, such as industry-leading NordVPN.\n\n\n\n### Purpose\n\n  * Execute the\
  \ day-to-day operations of Gnosis VPN.\n  * Interface with vendors, contributors,\
  \ and external partners.  \nThis may seem vague, but we’ve been advised that it\
  \ is sound legal strategy for the purpose and bylaws to provide a wide and flexible\
  \ mandate that allows Seldon Inc to engage in a broad range of commercial and operational\
  \ activities. In practice, this would include the ability to develop, distribute\
  \ and commercialise technology products and services, manage financial and banking\
  \ operations, enter into contracts of all types, and hold or transact in various\
  \ forms of property, including fiat and crypto. We believe this aligns with this\
  \ GIP’s general goal of enabling effective execution and risk management.\n\n\n\n\
  ### Ownership Structure\n\nSeldon Inc will be 100% owned by Gnosis DAO Operational\
  \ Foundation (Cayman). This structure ensures continued ownership by the Gnosis\
  \ DAO.\n\n### Operational Legal Costs\n\nEstablishing this entity in Panama will\
  \ incur the following legal costs:\n\n  * Incorporation: up to USD 5,110\n  * Annual:\
  \ up to USD 4,300  \nPayment can be made in crypto, subject to a 3% fee.\n\n\n\n\
  ### Governance\n\nThe entity would be required to have a board of three directors\
  \ appointed by a local agent in Panama. However, no control need be ceded to this\
  \ board: the bylaws of the entity would dictate that all decisions must be approved\
  \ by the Gnosis VPN Committee and the board must follow the instruction of the Gnosis\
  \ VPN committee.  \nMore formally, the following terms of reference (“**Terms of\
  \ Reference** ”) would govern the Gnosis VPN Committee:\n\n  * **Mandate** :\n \
  \ * Act as a liaison between Gnosis DAO, Gnosis Ltd, HOPR, and Seldon Inc.\n  *\
  \ Instruct Seldon Inc on all matters in relation to the Gnosis VPN project, including\
  \ but not limited to:\n  * i. execution of any contracts, partnership agreements,\
  \ letters, transactions, or any other form of agreement that Seldon Inc is required\
  \ to enter into; \n    * ii. approval of any financial related matters including\
  \ accounts, budgets, audit statements, or otherwise;\n    * iii. appointment and\
  \ removal of directors to the board of Seldon Inc; and\n    * iv. approval of any\
  \ other operational matters in relation to Seldon Inc\n\n\n\nInstruct Gnosis DAO\
  \ Operational Foundation (Cayman) in relation to its capacity as shareholder of\
  \ Seldon Inc on all matters of corporate and shareholder governance in respect of\
  \ Seldon Inc.  \nUpdate the Gnosis DAO on the activities of Seldon Inc and the Committee,\
  \ as appropriate and at least once a quarter.\n\n  * **Appointment and removal of\
  \ Committee Members** :\n\n    * Subject always to the overriding appointment and\
  \ removal rights of the GnosisDAO (as further outlined below), the committee shall\
  \ consist of [3] members, namely:\n    * one person appointed and removed by the\
  \ HOPR Association (the “**HOPR Appointee** ”). The first HOPR Appointee shall be\
  \ Tino Breddin.\n    * one person as appointed and removed by Gnosis Limited, who\
  \ shall be infrastructure / product focused (the “**Ltd Appointee** ”). The first\
  \ Ltd Appointee shall be Philippe Schommers\n    * one person as appointed and removed\
  \ by the Gnosis DAO (the “**DAO Appointee** ”). During Phase 1, the DAO Appointee\
  \ was selected as Staworth Ltd  \n(together the HOPR Appointee, Ltd Appointee, and\
  \ the DAO Appointee are the “**Committee Members** ”, and each a “**Committee Member**\
  \ ”).  \nNone of the Committee Members shall be entitled to remuneration in respect\
  \ of their appointment as a Committee Member.\n  * **Term**\n\n  * The Committee\
  \ Members shall be elected for a term of one (1) year.\n\n    * With regards to\
  \ the HOPR Appointee, HOPR Association may reappoint the currently appointed HOPR\
  \ Appointee for a further term of one (1) year, or it may appoint a new HOPR Appointee.\n\
  \    * With regards to the Ltd Appointee, Gnosis Ltd may reappoint the currently\
  \ appointed Ltd Appointee for a further term of one (1) year, or it may appoint\
  \ a new Ltd Appointee.\n    * With regards to the DAO Appointee, thirty (30) days\
  \ prior to the conclusion of each term, a re-election window will be opened. During\
  \ this period any member of the Gnosis DAO may nominate alternative candidates for\
  \ the position of the DAO Appointee by proposing an alternative candidate to the\
  \ community (via GIP or otherwise). \n      * If a new DAO Appointee is proposed,\
  \ the nomination shall be put to a poll vote of the GnosisDAO.\n      * The candidate\
  \ receiving the majority of votes in the GnosisDAO poll shall be appointed as the\
  \ DAO Appointee.\n      * If no alternative nominations are made for the position\
  \ of DAO Appointee, the current DAO Appointee shall automatically remain in position\
  \ for the subsequent one-year term.\n    * There is no limit to the number of consecutive\
  \ terms a Committee Member may serve.\n  * **Quorum**\n\n    * A quorum shall consist\
  \ of a majority of Committee Members (i.e., two out of three).\n    * No meeting\
  \ of the Gnosis VPN Committee shall proceed to business unless a quorum is present.\n\
  \    * Decisions shall be made by a simple majority vote of those present.\n   \
  \ * In the event of a tie, no Committee Member shall have a casting vote.\n  * **Variation\
  \ of the Terms of Reference**\n\n  * Notwithstanding any other term of the Terms\
  \ of Reference, Gnosis DAO can at any time by means of a Gnosis Improvement Proposal\
  \ (GIP):\n\n  * appoint and remove any Committee Member;\n\n    * amend or remove\
  \ the appointment rights of the HOPR Association, or Gnosis Ltd in respect of any\
  \ Committee Member;\n    * amend the maximum or minimum number of Committee Members;\n\
  \    * otherwise amend, remove, or replace the structure of the Gnosis VPN Committee,\
  \ or make any other amendment to the mandate conferred under these Terms of Reference.\n\
  \  * Unless explicitly provided herein, GnosisDAO does not have the authority to\
  \ retroactively cancel, reverse, or override specific operational decisions made\
  \ by the Gnosis VPN Committee or Seldon Inc.\n\n\n\n\n### Expected Committee Actions\n\
  \nIt’s impossible to fully explicate all actions which the Gnosis VPN Committee\
  \ might need to take, but at least for the duration of GIP-122 the Gnosis VPN Committee\
  \ is expected to primarily operate in a communication and approval role, by taking\
  \ the following actions:\n\n  * Instruct the Board of Seldon Inc as needed to establish\
  \ the necessary contracts for Gnosis VPN to operate (cloud computing platforms,\
  \ leasing IP subnet, app store listings, etc.).\n  * Respond in a timely fashion\
  \ to any developments related to these contracts.\n  * Assess and report on the\
  \ development milestones laid out in GIP-122.\n  * Interface with the Gnosis DAO\
  \ community to provide transparency.\n  * Post updates to the Gnosis DAO forum on\
  \ at least a quarterly basis.\n  * Ensure separation of concerns with HOPR while\
  \ maintaining compatibility where relevant.\n  * Management of the vpn.gnosis.eth\
  \ subdomain via a 2-of-3 Safe multsig at 0x52DBEE728cA95D0cbd8D211aa7a93377eCaa47d2\n\
  \n\n\nThe quorum rules explained above mean that two out of three Committee Members\
  \ are able to call a meeting of the Gnosis VPN Committee, but if they disagree on\
  \ a decision, the only way to break the tie is to reconvene with the third member\
  \ present. This feels like the correct balance between remaining dynamic while maintaining\
  \ checks and balances.\n\nAs we move out of GIP-122, we expect this governance structure\
  \ to evolve to see Seldon Inc taking a more executive role in the further development\
  \ of Gnosis VPN. Although this may end up looking very different to the current\
  \ structure, we think it’s wise to lay the foundations of this now, with a plan\
  \ to further develop this with the coordination of Gnosis DAO and the Gnosis VPN\
  \ Committee in 2026.\n\n### Budget and Funding\n\nIn addition to the legal costs\
  \ outlined above, Seldon Inc requires a modest operational budget, mostly earmarked\
  \ for devops and infrastructure costs. Current estimates are for 14 virtual machines,\
  \ with a range of specifications, to handle gnosisvpn-js and exit nodes in staging\
  \ and production. A 20% buffer is included in case specifications change, with any\
  \ further increase requiring a request to the DAO from the Gnosis VPN Committee.\
  \ The budget below includes all projected costs, including the monthly directors’\
  \ fee but not the one-off incorporation fee (to be confirmed, up to $5,110)\n\n\
  Item | Description | USD / month  \n---|---|---  \nCloud Computing | 14 virtual\
  \ machines | 1,950  \nNetworking | ~10% of infra costs | 195  \nSupport | ~20% of\
  \ infra costs | 390  \nSeldon Admin | Panamanian Director Fees | 360  \nIP Leasing\
  \ | /24 IP range subnet | 120  \nGoogle Workspace | Business Starter (5 users @\
  \ $8/mo) | 40  \n**Buffer** | 20% costs buffer | **611**  \n**Monthly Total (Pre-Tax)**\
  \ |  | **3,666**  \nTax | VAT @ 21% | 770  \n**Monthly Total (Post-Tax)** |  | **4,436**\
  \  \n**Annual Total (Post-Tax) |  | $53,232**  \n  \nPayment for the indicated services\
  \ will occur via a dedicated crypto corporate payment service. Dakota has been provisionally\
  \ chosen, but an alternative may need to be selected in the unlikely event that\
  \ onboarding cannot be completed. If the GIP passes, payment of funds should be\
  \ made to the service address provided by the Committee once onboarding is complete.\n\
  \nNote that Seldon Inc is also expected to earn revenue via its exit nodes, although\
  \ the amounts will depend on user numbers and traffic. If the exit nodes are also\
  \ used as relay nodes in the HOPR mixnet, they will earn HOPR tokens for relaying,\
  \ as well as the cover traffic which is distributed to all eligible HOPR nodes.\n\
  \n### Support from other services within the Gnosis Ecosystem\n\nAlthough Gnosis\
  \ VPN is conceived as an independent project, it will naturally receive support\
  \ from elsewhere in the Gnosis ecosystem. HOPR will provide the largest input here,\
  \ particularly during the two years of GIP-122, being responsible for technical\
  \ product development of the Gnosis VPN exit application and client apps as well\
  \ as the underlying HOPR protocol and client apps.\n\nHowever, Gnosis VPN will require\
  \ other support and assets, legal, community and frontend support, as well as tokens\
  \ (HOPR tokens and xDAI) to run its nodes. These token amounts are modest, but do\
  \ need to be sourced from somewhere.\n\nThe nature and source of this support will\
  \ ultimately be up to the committee to decide, but the following is a speculative\
  \ list of what Gnosis VPN might require and where it might get it from:\n\nOther\
  \ services / assets | Provided by  \n---|---  \nSoftware development | HOPR Association\
  \  \nSoftware deployment | Gnosis Ltd  \nRPC provision | Gnosis Ltd  \nHOPR token\
  \ | DAO  \nxDAI token | DAO  \nLegal support | Gnosis Ltd  \nCommunity support |\
  \ Gnosis Ltd  \nDesign, frontend, website deployment | Gnosis Ltd  \nGnosis VPN\
  \ level 2 support | HOPR Association  \n  \nNone of these are currently expected\
  \ to incur any costs, although in future this might change.\n\n## DAO Actions\n\n\
  If this proposal passes, the DAO will need to take the following actions:\n\n  1.\
  \ To transfer control of the vpn.gnosis.eth subdomain to the committee, the Gnosis\
  \ DAO account which manages gnosis.eth needs to execute the following transaction:\n\
  \n\n    \n    \n    [{\n    \"to\": \"0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e\"\
  ,\n    \"operation\": \"0\",\n    \"value\": \"0\",\n    \"method\": \"setSubnodeRecord(bytes32\
  \ node, bytes32 label, address owner, address resolver, uint64 ttl)\",\n    \"params\"\
  : [\n    \"0x77651e2c25d2b7b073d1068420770f96a43563e74df60e234b2433b2be66e29e\"\
  ,\n    \"0x2ce97c9211fa84e87d7ac228d6cecb896154ebcbb63414e2f3fbe4cb2d71b7d6\",\n\
  \    \"0x52DBEE728cA95D0cbd8D211aa7a93377eCaa47d2\",\n    \"0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41\"\
  ,\n    \"0\"\n    ]\n    }]\n    \n\nfor verification, the parameters are:\n\n \
  \ * The namehash of gnosis.eth (can be checked at Name Processing | ENS Docs)\n\
  \  * The labelhash of vpn.gnosis.eth (can be checked at Name Processing | ENS Docs)\n\
  \  * The new owner (the Gnosis VPN Committee Safe)\n  * The resolver used for the\
  \ subname (the same one set in GIP-130)\n  * The TTL, kept as the default\n\n\n\n\
  This is being called on the ENS Registry: < (also check here: Deployments | ENS\
  \ Docs)\n\n  2. Once onboarding with the chosen crypto corporate payment service\
  \ is complete, the requested 50,000 USDC should be transferred to the address provided\
  \ by the Committee.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nApproving this proposal will enable\
  \ GnosisDAO to efficiently scale Gnosis VPN with appropriate legal and operational\
  \ infrastructure, while maintaining GnosisDAO oversight and alignment with the broader\
  \ Gnosis ecosystem. While we don’t expect the entity or committee to take many actions\
  \ in the first 12 months, we think it’s important to lay the groundwork well in\
  \ advance to give Gnosis VPN the best chance to thrive.\n\n7 Likes\n\nGnosisDAO\
