title: Should GnosisDAO establish Seldon Inc and appoint a Gnosis VPN Committee to
  support the Gnosis VPN project?
body: "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE PROPOSAL: https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-129-should-gnosisdao-establish-seldon-inc-and-appoint-a-gnosis-vpn-committee-to-support-the-gnosis-vpn-project/10316\n\
  \nSummary:\n\nIn GIP-98 , Gnosis DAO approved initial research and development for\
  \ an anonymous VPN running on top of the HOPR mixnet 1, called Gnosis VPN. After\
  \ a successful proof of concept, in GIP-122 , GnosisDAO approved further development\
  \ to bring the project to market over two years.\n\nHOPR is responsible for developing\
  \ the software for the first version of Gnosis VPN, including the Gnosis VPN client\
  \ itself and improvements to the HOPR mixnet and HOPR Session Protocol needed to\
  \ make Gnosis VPN work. However, the goal is for Gnosis VPN to be a standalone project\
  \ entirely separate from the underlying infrastructure and the HOPR team.\n\nTo\
  \ achieve this, Gnosis VPN already requires a legal entity to interact with various\
  \ vendors and service providers. It also needs a simple governance structure to\
  \ make decisions and instruct this entity.\n\nThis proposal seeks approval to incorporate\
  \ a new legal entity and establish a delegated Gnosis VPN Committee to instruct\
  \ it. The proposed name will be Seldon Inc, subject to it being accepted by the\
  \ local authorities. Otherwise, alternative names given for the entity are Mallow\
  \ Inc and Maelcum Inc.\n\nThis proposal will explain the rationale for Seldon Inc,\
  \ its structure and initial operational budget, as well as the committee’s structure\
  \ and mandate.\n\nMotivation\nWhy does Gnosis VPN need a dedicated entity? We expect\
  \ Gnosis VPN to play a fundamental role in achieving Gnosis’ goal of creating the\
  \ open internet. Anonymous, unblockable, and uncensorable internet access is essential\
  \ for sovereign digital identity. VPN services are also big business, with an estimated\
  \ annual market size of $130bn by 2030. Estimates for 2024 (made in 2020) were all\
  \ exceeded, so there’s a strong chance that this 2030 estimate will prove conservative.\n\
  \nIt was always envisioned that Gnosis VPN would grow to be its own project, separate\
  \ from HOPR and Gnosis Ltd. Once Gnosis VPN is market ready, it will need to scale,\
  \ and the primary focus will shift from software development to business development.\
  \ HOPR is not necessarily best placed to provide this, and in the spirit of web3\
  \ it is wise to separate the infrastructure layer from the services running on top\
  \ of it.\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, three legal options for stewarding a project\
  \ like Gnosis VPN:\n\nUse no incorporated entity at all\nRun Gnosis VPN using an\
  \ existing Gnosis entity\nEstablish a new entity for Gnosis VPN\n\nThe first may\
  \ seem appealing for an anonymous web3 VPN powered by a mixnet, but this is infeasible.\
  \ The goal is to make Gnosis VPN accessible to everyone, which requires a streamlined\
  \ UX and ready availability of the Gnosis VPN software. On mobile this means being\
  \ listed in app stores, which will require an incorporated entity to apply for and\
  \ maintain the listing.\n\nIt is also not desirable to subsume Gnosis VPN under\
  \ an existing Gnosis entity, as Gnosis has a longstanding tradition of decentralization\
  \ on this front. Like all VPNs, Gnosis VPN is likely to face some level of regulatory\
  \ scrutiny, which also makes it unwise to lump it together with other Gnosis entities.\n\
  \nOwnership Structure\nSeldon Inc will be 100% owned by Gnosis DAO Operational Foundation\
  \ (Cayman). This structure ensures continued ownership by the Gnosis DAO.\n\nBudget\
  \ and Funding\nIn addition to the legal costs outlined above, Seldon Inc requires\
  \ a modest operational budget, mostly earmarked for devops and infrastructure costs.\
  \ Current estimates are for 14 virtual machines, with a range of specifications,\
  \ to handle gnosisvpn-js and exit nodes in staging and production. A 20% buffer\
  \ is included in case specifications change, with any further increase requiring\
  \ a request to the DAO from the Gnosis VPN Committee. The budget below includes\
  \ all projected costs, including the monthly directors’ fee but not the one-off\
  \ incorporation fee (to be confirmed, up to $5,110)\n\nCloud Computing 14 virtual\
  \ machines\t1,950\nNetworking\t~10% of infra costs\t195\nSupport\t~20% of infra\
  \ costs\t390\nSeldon Admin\tPanamanian Director Fees\t360\nIP Leasing\t/24 IP range\
  \ subnet\t120\nGoogle Workspace\tBusiness Starter (5 users @ $8/mo)\t40\nBuffer\t\
  20% costs buffer\t611\nMonthly Total (Pre-Tax)\t\t3,666\nTax\tVAT @ 21%\t770\nMonthly\
  \ Total (Post-Tax)\t\t4,436\n**Annual Total (Post-Tax)\t\t$53,232**\n\nPayment for\
  \ the indicated services will occur via a dedicated crypto corporate payment service.\
  \ Dakota has been provisionally chosen, but an alternative may need to be selected\
  \ in the unlikely event that onboarding cannot be completed. If the GIP passes,\
  \ payment of funds should be made to the service address provided by the Committee\
  \ once onboarding is complete.\n\nNote that Seldon Inc is also expected to earn\
  \ revenue via its exit nodes, although the amounts will depend on user numbers and\
  \ traffic. If the exit nodes are also used as relay nodes in the HOPR mixnet, they\
  \ will earn HOPR tokens for relaying, as well as the cover traffic which is distributed\
  \ to all eligible HOPR nodes.\n\nConclusion\nApproving this proposal will enable\
  \ GnosisDAO to efficiently scale Gnosis VPN with appropriate legal and operational\
  \ infrastructure, while maintaining GnosisDAO oversight and alignment with the broader\
  \ Gnosis ecosystem. While we don’t expect the entity or committee to take many actions\
  \ in the first 12 months, we think it’s important to lay the groundwork well in\
  \ advance to give Gnosis VPN the best chance to thrive."
