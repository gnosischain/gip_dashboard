  \nThe Reward Systems Token Engineering Initiative will run an #OpenScience program\
  \ on the topic of DAO Rewards Systems. We'll offer education and collaborative research\
  \ for Token Engineers specializing in Governance, the aim is to come up with Zodiac\
  \ DAO Improvement proposals.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\nIn November 2021, we'll kick-off\
  \ a community research initiative on Rewards Systems and bring together 20-30 researchers\
  \ from various backgrounds to work on Rewards Systems for DAOs. The work will be\
  \ based on real DAO cases. We'll offer an extensive educational program and facilitate\
  \ the research process to create maximum output.\\\nThis is an excellent opportunity\
  \ for Gnosis Zodiac to create attention, and work collectively on Zodiac DAO Improvement\
  \ Proposals.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nRewards Systems are a vital element for\
  \ DAOs to compensate builders for contributions and grant decision-making power\
  \ and co-ownership to those who are so critical for a DAO's value. Ecosystem Development\
  \ via proposals and grants has become a popular method to distribute funds, and\
  \ establish a shared perspective on value-add. All Rewards Systems need reliable\
  \ value assignment, to ultimately lead to a healthy reward distribution.\n\nThe\
  \ Governauts Rewards System Research initiative will explore:\n\n-   How to best\
  \ track contributions and account for the richness of value adds that come in many\
  \ forms: code, communication, care, creativity\n-   how to assign value, how to\
  \ define value and associated roles, and permissions\n-   what do stakeholders expect\
  \ from rewards, and does the system in place meet these requirements\n-   what are\
  \ metrics to measure the reward system healthiness - in its respective lifecycle\n\
  \nSpecification\n-------------\n\nWe'll provide education:\n\n-   case introductions:\n\
  -   DAO cases with a Rewards System in production (TE Commons, Ocean DAO, NearDAO\
  \ etc.)\n-   partner talks, incl. Zodiac\n-   Token Engineering fundamentals\n-\
  \   DAO case studies and insights from Gitcoin, CommonsStack, BlockScience, TE Commons,\
  \ and more\n-   multidisciplinary insights from game design, behavioral economics,\
  \ currency design, and monetary theory\n\nand mentoring:\n\n-   define an own research\
  \ question in the scope of Rewards Systems\n-   use methods from the Token Engineering\
  \ toolkit\n-   form multidisciplinary teams\n-   produce actual outcome\n\nThis\
  \ program is open to anyone, and free.\\\nWe'll have an application process to ensure\
  \ that participants\n\n-   have the right background, e.g., Political Science, Behavioral\
  \ Economics, Mechanism Design or Data Analytics\n-   commit the next three months\
  \ to work on Rewards System Research questions\n-   attend an education program,\
  \ learn and work on a self-defined research question\n\nRationale\n---------\n\n\
  This program is organized by TE Academy. The mission of TE Academy is to develop\
  \ the Token Engineering discipline and grow the number of skilled Token Engineers\
  \ in crypto. TE Academy has run research initiatives like this several times already:\n\

  \ Governauts is an initiative to establish a dedicated branch in Token Engineering\
  \ focused on decentralization and governance.\\\nWe organize workshops and discussions,\
  \ provide a platform for collaboration and bring research programs to life with\
  \ TE Academy.\n\nImplementation\n--------------\n\nWe'll deliver in three steps:\n\
  \n-   Zodiac workshop:\\\n    with researchers, partners and DAO stakeholders as\
  \ a roundtable to create awareness and set the scope for Zodiac DAO Improvement\
  \ Proposals\n-   Research documentation:\\\n    community researchers work on Rewards\
  \ Systems and\n    -   document their results in public HackMDs/Github repos and\n\
  \    -   discuss progress in weekly sessions (all sessions are recorded and shared\
  \ publicly!)\n    -   share their results in a final presentations event (public)\n\
  -   Handover to Zodiac bounty/grant program\\\n    to further develop most interesting\
  \ results in DAO Improvement proposals\n"
