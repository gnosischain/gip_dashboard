title: 'Should Gnosis DAO proceed and deploy CowDAO and vCOW token? '
body: 'The proposal is available [here](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-13-phase-2-cowdao-and-cow-token/2735/1).
  It is recommended to read it in the forum where proper formatting is available. 


  The proposed deployment code for this proposal is available [here](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token/)
  and an audit is available [here](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token/blob/main/audits/2021-12_G0-group.pdf).


  # What is CowDAO envisioned to be? 


  CowDAO is an open organization of developers, traders, market makers and many more
  community members aligned with its vision. CowDAO is focused on fair and decentralized
  trading systems - in particular, building, maintaining and advancing the Cow Protocol.
  Cow Protocol technology powers a network of traders and solvers, enabling trustless
  and efficient peer-to-peer trading. Leveraging batch auctions as a key concept uniquely
  positions Cow Protocol as native trading infrastructure for discrete-time settlement
  layers like Ethereum and enables fair and accessible trading to its users.


  # Vision


  We foresee a future where increasingly all kinds of assets will be tokenized on
  Ethereum and other decentralized blockchains, where everyone - individuals and collectives
  - can have full custody of their tokenized assets. CowDAO''s vision is a decentralized
  future where digital assets can be traded in a fair, efficient and reliable manner
  among people and communities around the world. Our mission is to build a protocol
  that becomes the most user friendly and price effective way to exchange digital
  assets, enabling all users to trade securely and know their trades are protected.


  We are determined to make Cow Protocol the foundational liquidity hub for trading
  digital assets by applying continuous innovation, cultivating intellectual bravery
  and by expanding the CoW Protocol ecosystem - inviting the brightest minds to join
  the community.


  # Values and Principles


  This section should not limit the scope of what CowDAO can pursue or achieve. The
  community should keep iterating on its values and principles to best reflect each
  and every member individually and the DAO as a whole.


  Below are work in progress principles that we propose should guide the way we behave
  as a community and help shape the decision process for CowDAO.


  # Universal Simplicity


  The goal of Cowswap is to allow easy access to the decentralized economy across
  all levels of experience, the Cowswap community will focus on simplicity and high
  quality user experience across DeFi and Web3.


  # Decentralization and Access to everybody


  Cow Protocol is permissionless for anyone to access with no discrimination. The
  Cowswap community will reward alternative UIs and gateways to the protocol in order
  to ensure easy worldwide access and usability in accordance with applicable laws.


  # Open Collaboration


  CowSwap should be a core part of Ethereum and Web3, we believe this can be achieved
  by openly collaborating with other teams, protocols and communities in the decentralized
  ecosystem. Education, information sharing and aligned partnerships are key drivers
  to build out the CowSwap ecosystem.


  # Proposed Governance Parameters for CowDAO Launch 


  -   CowDAO proposals will be discussed on CowDAO''s dedicated Forum, consisting
  of two phases: forum discussion and snapshot voting.


  -   Final approval of proposals will be made through vCOW token voting on the cow.eth
  snapshot space that will be deployed upon GIP-13 successfully passing.


  -   A maximum amount of 560M vCOW tokens will become available, out of which it 
  is estimated that up to 350m vCOW tokens might  be used  for voting initially. A
  quorum is proposed that would require roughly 10%  of this supply for approving
  CowDAO Improvement Proposals (CIP). This is defined by a set limit of  35m COW tokens
  required to vote YES in order for a proposal to pass.


  -   Additionally, in order for a proposal to be approved, YES votes should account
  for >50% of total participating votes. (simple majority)'
