title: Should GnosisDAO fund the GnosisGov Navigator, a governance and delegate dashboard?
body: "## Executive Summary\n\n### Problem:\n\nGnosis DAO governance faces fragmented\
  \ delegate information and low participation due to:\n\n  * Token holders manually\
  \ compiling delegate data from multiple sources\n  * Lack of timely governance updates\
  \ for delegates\n  * Absence of standardized metrics for evaluating delegate performance\n\
  \n\n\n### Solution:\n\nFund the development of Gov Navigator, a two-pronged system\
  \ to:\n\n  1. Delegate Dashboard: Centralize delegate analytics (activity, alignment,\
  \ influence)\n  2. Privacy-First Telegram Bot: Automate governance notifications\
  \ without personal data\n\n\n\n### Ecosystem Benefits:\n\n  * Projected increase\
  \ in delegate participation\n  * Reduction in token holder research time\n  * Improved\
  \ transparency for informed delegation decisions\n\n\n\n## About PYOR\n\nPYOR specializes\
  \ in crypto research and analytics. The team has over 10 years of experience building\
  \ in the crypto space. We are backed by leading investors like Castle Island Ventures\
  \ and Coinbase Ventures and work with teams like Arbitrum, Cosmos, Ribbit Capital,\
  \ Compound, etc.\n\nPYOR is an official delegate for Wormhole and zkSync, committed\
  \ to contributing to the success of both DAOs.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEffective governance\
  \ is the foundation of any successful DAO. At Gnosis, we’ve observed growing challenges\
  \ that hinder the collective decision-making processes. Delegate information is\
  \ scattered across multiple platforms in threads, making it difficult for token\
  \ holders to evaluate whom to trust with their voting power. Meanwhile, delegates\
  \ struggle to stay informed about new proposals and voting deadlines.\n\nGov Navigator\
  \ aims to address these practical challenges by providing a comprehensive solution\
  \ that serves both delegates and token holders. By centralizing delegate information,\
  \ standardizing performance metrics, and implementing a privacy-focused notification\
  \ system, we can significantly improve governance participation and transparency.\n\
  \n## Specification\n\nThe Gov Navigator will deliver two integrated components to\
  \ enhance governance transparency and participation:\n\n### 1\\. Delegate Dashboard\n\
  \nComponent | Functionality  \n---|---  \nMacro Metrics | Proposal trends (success\
  \ rates, categories), voting power distribution (Gini coefficient), delegate onboarding\
  \ rates  \nDelegate Profiles | Activity (votes made/missed), alignment (vs. outcomes),\
  \ influence (voting power share), proposal-level insights  \nProposal Views | Compare\
  \ delegate voting patterns, visualize voting timelines, track lifecycle stages \
  \ \n  \n### 2\\. Telegram Bot\n\nFeature | Functionality  \n---|---  \nAutomated\
  \ Alerts | New proposals (with summaries), voting deadlines (48h/24h/1h reminders),\
  \ execution updates  \nPrivacy Design | Closed group access, no personal data required\
  \  \n  \n#### Please go through the following document to see all the deliverables\
  \ in detail: Here\n\n## Rationale\n\n### Community Consensus:\n\n  * Feedback received\
  \ by delegates (@lefterisjp, @Viszla) for addressing engagement gaps\n  * Aligns\
  \ with GnosisDAO’s strategic focus on governance health\n\n\n\n### Alternatives\
  \ Considered:\n\n  * We rejected a native app approach due to reliance on third-party\
  \ infrastructure\n  * Tally/Curia: Limited to passive dashboards without proactive\
  \ engagement tools\n\n\n\n## Why Our Team?\n\nPYOR has established itself as a trusted\
  \ analytics provider in the blockchain ecosystem, with a proven track record in\
  \ developing governance analytics solutions for leading protocols such as:\n\n \
  \ * Arbitrum: Developed LTIPP Incentive Program Analytics dashboard\n  * Compound\
  \ Finance: Created a comprehensive lending and yield tracker dashboard with borrower/supplier\
  \ metrics\n  * EigenLayer: Built a complete dashboard tracking assets delegated,\
  \ delegators, operators, and AVSs\n  * ICP: Developed a governance and DAO rewards\
  \ visualization system\n  * Cosmos: Delivered consumer chain and validators analytics\n\
  \n\n\nOur experience directly aligns with the requirements of the Gnosis Gov Navigator\
  \ project, demonstrating proficiency in:\n\n  * Governance analytics and dashboard\
  \ development\n  * Delegate performance metrics\n  * Notification systems for timely\
  \ updates\n  * Custom metrics development for protocol-specific needs\n\n\n\nPYOR’s\
  \ service quality is characterized by regular data updates, multiple communication\
  \ channels, and flexible output formats. Our existing technical infrastructure is\
  \ already configured to deliver the proposed features of Gov Navigator, including\
  \ on-chain analytics integration, advanced visualization capabilities, and custom\
  \ formula development for governance-specific metrics.\n\n## Budget\n\nTotal Request:\
