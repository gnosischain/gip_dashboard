title: Should the DAO pay out a bounty for a disclosure regarding a consensus discrepancy
  on Gnosis Chain?
body: "## Summary\n\nOn Feb 25, 2025, [cergyk](https://x.com/cergyk1337) reported\
  \ a vulnerability in Gnosis Chain that could have caused a chain split if exploited.\
  \ An ill-intentioned validator could have triggered this issue by setting the coinbase\
  \ of their block to a contract that was created and self-destructed in said block.\n\
  \nThe issue was solved in Nethermind on Mar 17, 2025 in pull request [#8376](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/pull/8376).\n\
  \nWhile Gnosis Chain does not have a bug bounty in place, it acknowledges and values\
  \ the contributions of ethical security researchers (“white hats”) who help protect\
  \ network integrity. In recognition of the responsible disclosure of this vulnerability,\
  \ the core team proposes, on a voluntary and one‑time basis, to award the reporting\
  \ researcher $10k.\n\n## The vulnerability\n\nIf a block proposer crafted a transaction\
  \ in which a contract was created and immediately self-destructed, and then set\
  \ the address of that contract as their coinbase, they would have triggered a chain\
  \ split. This would have happened because Nethermind and Erigon did not agree exactly\
  \ on how to process this type of transaction.\n\nMore specifically, the base fee\
  \ would not have been collected by the Nethermind client, whereas it would have\
  \ been in Erigon. The offending code can be found [here](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/pull/8376/files#diff-b8ea3d5dd4a8bedda3ec0900ae86bf6c3352c28fcec738e3064511be8c9c52e7).\n\
  \nThis would have resulted in two different chains continuing along on their own\
  \ forks. As there were mainly two active clients, we would have seen:\n\n- The buggy\
  \ Nethermind chain with ~80% of the stake that would have kept finalizing (as they\
  \ would have had more than ⅔ of the stake)  \n- The legitimate Erigon chain with\
  \ <20% of the stake that would not have finalized for a long time\n\n## The resolution\n\
  \nThe right way of calculating the gas collected by the fee collector was implemented\
  \ by Erigon, and Nethermind had a consensus discrepancy. We thus decided to fix\
  \ this issue on Nethermind’s side to stay in sync with Erigon. This did not cause\
  \ any problems as the consensus issue had never been triggered.\n\nIf it had, we\
  \ would have had to make the discrepancy in Nethermind canonical, as the vast majority\
  \ (80%+) of the network was and is still running Nethermind. This would have unfairly\
  \ penalized validators running Erigon, as they would effectively have been written\
  \ out of the chain’s history between the block in which the issue would have been\
  \ triggered and the moment a new release would have been made available for Erigon.\
  \ This would have caused attestation penalties and missed block proposals for Erigon\
  \ validators.\n\nWhile this is unfair, the alternative would have been way worse,\
  \ as Nethermind validators could never have re-joined Erigon’s chain without getting\
  \ slashed. The whole network would thus have needed to reduce the staked balance\
  \ by applying an inactivity leak to all Nethermind validators, and then kicked them\
  \ out of the network because of low balance. This would effectively have burned\
  \ ~40% of all the GNO staked on Gnosis Chain.\n\nThe core dev team takes this opportunity\
  \ to remind everyone that client diversity is extremely important, and that anyone\
  \ running Nethermind validators should move to a minority client, like [Erigon](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon),\
  \ [Reth](https://github.com/gnosischain/reth_gnosis) or [Geth](https://github.com/gnosischain/go-ethereum)."
