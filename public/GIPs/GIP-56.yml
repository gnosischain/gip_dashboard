  \    created: 2022-06-30\n    \n\n##  Simple Summary\n\nKairos is a platform that\
  \ provides an education for students to learn through certifications about the different\
  \ aspects of the ecosystem FOR FREE.  \nThere is no free education for students\
  \ in the ecosystem yet, which should be a priority to work towards innovation and\
  \ adoption.\n\nEach blockchain or protocol provides education and ressources from\
  \ three angles: the programming language of their company, a presentation of the\
  \ ecosystem and how it works, and a training on the company’s marketing & entrepreneurship\
  \ model.\n\nWe already have a student network gathered with over 3 000 students\
  \ from universities such as Cambridge, Stanford, Dauphine and more.  \nWe are always\
  \ growing our network so if you are a student interested to learn about the ecosystem\
  \ please reach out to [contact@kairostudents.com](mailto:contact@kairostudents.com)\n\
  \n##  Abstract\n\nIn the ecosystem, it is challenging for companies to find competent\
  \ and committed individuals to build and contribute to projects.  \nThe Kairos team\
  \ has spoken with several blockchain companies who have stated that they find suitable\
  \ profiles for hire only months later, if ever.  \nThis comes from the lack of democratization\
  \ of blockchain and mainly the lack of education of the new generation on the topic,\
  \ only 2% of the top universities offer courses on blockchain and they are rarely\
  \ in-depth.\n\nIn parallel, the cheapest price on the market for a student to learn\
  \ about blockchain is $4,000. This price is unacceptable for students who have to\
  \ deal with a heavy workload in addition to their studies.  \nBesides, the courses\
  \ are often unorganized and focused on the general and never go into the specific.\n\
  \n##  Motivation\n\nThis is where Kairos comes in, working with key players of the\
  \ ecosystem to provide a free education.  \nMany investors are leaving the market\
  \ due to current condition but many students are seeing this as an opportunity to\
  \ learn and build.  \nBut where do you begin with no knowledge? In this crypted\
  \ ecosystem in which everything changes quickly through constant innovation, it’s\
  \ hard to keep track.  \nI have asked myself the same question 4 years ago when\
  \ no ressources existed and I have worked towards blockchain adoption and education\
  \ ever since.\n\nKairos is also an opportunity to see beyond developers education.\
  \ It is included in the three key topics but our team wanted to show that there\
  \ is more to building than code and that you don’t need a dev background to become\
  \ a key player of this ecosystem.  \nTherefore, we have decided to add courses and\
  \ certifications about the ecosystem (How is Gnosis different from the other solutions?\
  \ What are the main protocols built on Gnosis and how can you use them? How does\
  \ governance operate on Gnosis) and marketing on that blockchain (Where can you\
  \ find metrics about Gnosis ? What does it say about user behaviour? What are the\
  \ leading projects and how do they operate? What is amount of $GNO stacked and what\
  \ does it say about trust in Gnosis?).\n\n##  Specification\n\n  * Each student\
  \ will have to verify their student status by validating an email received on their\
  \ university email account. They will then have access to a functional site containing\
  \ the courses provided by the various partner organizations. These courses will\
  \ be classified following several parameters such as their difficulty, the level\
  \ required to pass them, the subject matter (development, marketing, project management,\
  \ etc.).  \nStudents will then have to register to the different programs offered\
  \ in order to follow their progress and know the attendance of each program.\n\n\
  \  * Once finished, students will have to provide **a project** proving their mastery\
  \ of the subject in order to obtain their certifications in the form of an NFT or\
  \ a document.  \nThe first 50 students will receive tokens of the partners sent\
  \ by Kairos.  \nThe most innovative projects will be eligible for funding and support\
  \ from Kairos and its partners, in order to provide maximum assistance and support\
  \ to the brightest minds.\n\n  * Our student network is organized as a **DAO** ,\
  \ international, constantly growing and waiting for your courses and certifications.\
  \ The DAO will allow students to choose how treasury is used, which topics to prioritize\
  \ and which topics will get funding.\n\n  * GnosisDAO will provide $20,000.00 xDAI\
  \ to Kairos, in exchange for making courses and certifications about Gnosis for\
  \ students.\n\n  * This grant is needed to remain the spirit of Kairos being free\
  \ for students and will be used for using the current ressources to make videos,\
  \ courses and quizzes about Gnosis.\n\n  * The distribution is 50% of the budget\
  \ being used for the courses and the platform, 25% of the grant to grow our student\
  \ network and communicate about the partnership, 15% to support students projects\
  \ and 10% for the team.\n\n  * We will bring visibility to Gnosis and enhance their\
  \ support to education on our platform, on socials and on our student network.\n\
  \n\n\n\n##  Rationale\n\nWe are students ourselves, hence the initiative of providing\
  \ a free education for students.  \nWorking with Gnosis will allow student education\
  \ about the ecosystem and certified students to build on Gnosis.  \nThis is a win-win\
  \ opportunity, let’s support student education and the next generation!\n\nFor more\

  \nEducation of students and especially pushing awareness of the possibilities of\
  \ BC in general and especially GC would be worth funding ofc. But looking at your\
  \ webpage and following the links I don’t see much about this, so I wonder which\
  \ priority this have to you. Myself, left medical school many years ago and being\
  \ a grandfather already, managed to educate myself about BC and GC a lot with freely\
  \ available resources. Therefore I am interested what kind of education you will\
  \ provide on top of these freely available resources. Can you point me to some links\
  \ on your website or is this a new area for you?\n\nedit: maybe I have looked the\
  \ wrong place: <https://kairosstudents.com/> isn’t yours? Do you have some other\
  \ link for me?\n\n1 Like\n\n[Kairos](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Kairos) June 30,\
  \ 2022, 1:46am  4\n\nHello! First of all, thank you for your feedback ![:slightly_smiling_face:](//forum.gnosis.io/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12)\n\
  \nHaving done the same self education myself a few years ago, I will have to agree\
  \ with you on how you can find ressources easily everywhere. That being said, I\
  \ believe the struggle is a bit different now.  \nBeing educated about blockchain\
  \ and seeing the ecosystem evolve these past years have made me able to understand\
  \ these changes, but with so many ecosystems, protocols and notions, people are\
  \ often confused about where to begin and which ressources are legit?  \nAdd being\
  \ a student on top of that and it’s easily a nightmare, students are motivated by\
  \ the recent adoption but give up quickly on blockchain education.  \nTherefore,\
  \ Kairos will be an open-classroom of blockchain, allowing them to pick their skills\
  \ and courses (not dev only for once) and get a certification at the end.  \nThis\
  \ is actually quite personal but for example I have never seen any blockchain tutorial\
  \ gathering all the protocols built on an ecosystem such as the explorer, swaps,\
  \ defi protocols specifically on that ecosystem, ect…  \nI believe this angle is\
  \ important on both sides (students vs blockchains/protocols) because once they\
  \ are certified, they will have access to job offers from blockchains and protocols\
  \ posted directly on Kairos. This is extra-motivation for a student, it’s free,\
  \ it’s easy to use and you get something real and valuable out of it at the end.\n\
  \nFor the website, you have the correct link with an extra S although we are currently\
  \ changing the landing page. I will ask for another link redirecting to the previous\
  \ website (three pages : landing, university partners and registration).  \nThe\
  \ Kairos team will be using the funding to establish the courses page, including\
  \ videos, script and certifications on Gnosis.\n\nI can also link the Linkedin profiles\
  \ of the team :\n\n<https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaina-salmi/>\n\n<https://www.linkedin.com/in/talamdiop>\n\
  \n<https://www.linkedin.com/in/louis-doidy>\n\nThe three of us are the founders\
  \ of the blockchain society of the University Paris-Dauphine, we are therefore familiar\
  \ with educating students on that topic. It is actually because we’ve witnessed\
  \ how complicated it was for students, even within a finance-oriented university,\
  \ to find time and ressources that we launched Kairos.  \nWe are working with professors\
  \ of our university to also bring education on that topic to students.  \nAs you\
  \ can see, we are truly education oriented and hopefully a few students will be\
  \ working on Gnosis thanks to Kairos one day.\n\nIf you have any question or would\
  \ like to discuss it more, feel free to reach out to me on TG: @LordLdm or Twitter:@DonAltcoins.\n\
  \n[refri](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/refri) June 30, 2022, 11:34am  5\n\nThanks for\
  \ your reply, a link to your previous page or an example of prior work would be\
  \ perfect ![:+1:](https://forum.gnosis.io/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=10).  \n\
  That said I like to emphasize I like education very much but I am suspicious about\
  \ ‘certificates’. Acquired too many in my life and can not get rid of the impression\
  \ we are exaggerating this in many fields of life and especially work. It’s nearly\
  \ impossible to judge from a certificate about the knowledge/skills of an applicant\
  \ and most benefit from this ‘certificate-industry’ seems to go to the organizations/ppl\
  \ that issue certificates.\n\n2 Likes\n\n  * [Home ](/)\n  * [Categories ](/categories)\n\
