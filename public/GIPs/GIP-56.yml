title: Should GnosisDAO fund student web3 education?
body: "##  Simple Summary\n\nKairos is a platform that provides an education for students\
  \ to learn through certifications about the different aspects of the ecosystem FOR\
  \ FREE.  \nThere is no free education for students in the ecosystem yet, which should\
  \ be a priority to work towards innovation and adoption.\n\nEach blockchain or protocol\
  \ provides education and ressources from three angles: the programming language\
  \ of their company, a presentation of the ecosystem and how it works, and a training\
  \ on the company’s marketing & entrepreneurship model.\n\nWe already have a student\
  \ network gathered with over 3 000 students from universities such as Cambridge,\
  \ Stanford, Dauphine and more.  \nWe are always growing our network so if you are\
  \ a student interested to learn about the ecosystem please reach out to contact@kairostudents.com\n\
  \n##  Abstract\n\nIn the ecosystem, it is challenging for companies to find competent\
  \ and committed individuals to build and contribute to projects.  \nThe Kairos team\
  \ has spoken with several blockchain companies who have stated that they find suitable\
  \ profiles for hire only months later, if ever.  \nThis comes from the lack of democratization\
  \ of blockchain and mainly the lack of education of the new generation on the topic,\
  \ only 2% of the top universities offer courses on blockchain and they are rarely\
  \ in-depth.\n\nIn parallel, the cheapest price on the market for a student to learn\
  \ about blockchain is $4,000. This price is unacceptable for students who have to\
  \ deal with a heavy workload in addition to their studies.  \nBesides, the courses\
  \ are often unorganized and focused on the general and never go into the specific.\n\
  \n##  Motivation\n\nThis is where Kairos comes in, working with key players of the\
  \ ecosystem to provide a free education.  \nMany investors are leaving the market\
  \ due to current condition but many students are seeing this as an opportunity to\
  \ learn and build.  \nBut where do you begin with no knowledge? In this crypted\
  \ ecosystem in which everything changes quickly through constant innovation, it’s\
  \ hard to keep track.  \nI have asked myself the same question 4 years ago when\
  \ no ressources existed and I have worked towards blockchain adoption and education\
  \ ever since.\n\nKairos is also an opportunity to see beyond developers education.\
  \ It is included in the three key topics but our team wanted to show that there\
  \ is more to building than code and that you don’t need a dev background to become\
  \ a key player of this ecosystem.  \nTherefore, we have decided to add courses and\
  \ certifications about the ecosystem (How is Gnosis different from the other solutions?\
  \ What are the main protocols built on Gnosis and how can you use them? How does\
  \ governance operate on Gnosis) and marketing on that blockchain (Where can you\
  \ find metrics about Gnosis ? What does it say about user behaviour? What are the\
  \ leading projects and how do they operate? What is amount of $GNO stacked and what\
  \ does it say about trust in Gnosis?).\n\n##  Specification\n\n  * Each student\
  \ will have to verify their student status by validating an email received on their\
  \ university email account. They will then have access to a functional site containing\
  \ the courses provided by the various partner organizations. These courses will\
  \ be classified following several parameters such as their difficulty, the level\
  \ required to pass them, the subject matter (development, marketing, project management,\
  \ etc.).  \nStudents will then have to register to the different programs offered\
  \ in order to follow their progress and know the attendance of each program.\n\n\
  \  * Once finished, students will have to provide **a project** proving their mastery\
  \ of the subject in order to obtain their certifications in the form of an NFT or\
  \ a document.  \nThe first 50 students will receive tokens of the partners sent\
  \ by Kairos.  \nThe most innovative projects will be eligible for funding and support\
  \ from Kairos and its partners, in order to provide maximum assistance and support\
  \ to the brightest minds.\n\n  * Our student network is organized as a **DAO** ,\
  \ international, constantly growing and waiting for your courses and certifications.\
  \ The DAO will allow students to choose how treasury is used, which topics to prioritize\
  \ and which topics will get funding.\n\n  * GnosisDAO will provide $20,000.00 xDAI\
  \ to Kairos, in exchange for making courses and certifications about Gnosis for\
  \ students.\n\n  * This grant is needed to remain the spirit of Kairos being free\
  \ for students and will be used for using the current ressources to make videos,\
  \ courses and quizzes about Gnosis.\n\n  * The distribution is 50% of the budget\
  \ being used for the courses and the platform, 25% of the grant to grow our student\
  \ network and communicate about the partnership, 15% to support students projects\
  \ and 10% for the team.\n\n  * We will bring visibility to Gnosis and enhance their\
  \ support to education on our platform, on socials and on our student network.\n\
  \n\n\n\n##  Rationale\n\nWe are students ourselves, hence the initiative of providing\
  \ a free education for students.  \nWorking with Gnosis will allow student education\
  \ about the ecosystem and certified students to build on Gnosis.  \nThis is a win-win\
  \ opportunity, let’s support student education and the next generation!\n\nFor more\
