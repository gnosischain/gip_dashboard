title: Should the GnosisDAO fund the Ethereum Protocol Attackathon?
body: 'Summary:


  Ethereum needs more security researchers to examine the codebase and help find vulnerabilities.
  As the ecosystem has grown, this is an excellent opportunity to co-fund an audit
  challenge with the Ethereum community.


  The Ethereum Foundation (EF) invites sponsors to support the reward pool for the
  eight-week Ethereum Attackathon.


  This event aims to enhance the security of the Ethereum protocol by organizing the
  largest crowdsourced security audit competition. The goal is to raise over $2 million,
  with $500,000 committed from the Ethereum Foundation.


  The Attackathon will be hosted on Immunefi, which they do at no cost, meaning all
  contributions go directly to securing the protocol.


  This challenge is especially relevant for Gnosis. Gnosis has a similar architecture,
  is the only EVM with a beacon chain and uses the same clients.


  A security bug bounty on the Ethereum core protocol benefits the Gnosis Chain by
  identifying shared vulnerabilities, enhancing overall security, and fostering a
  stronger developer community. This collaborative approach ensures cost-effective,
  high-quality security improvements and maintains trust and interoperability between
  the chains.


  Duration: Eight weeks


  Funding: 100,000 usd


  Specification


  What is an Attackathon?

  An Attackathon is a comprehensive event involving three phases:


  Before the Attackathon: A comprehensive education program on the protocol’s code
  delivered via live technical walkthroughs and Attackathon Academy content.


  During the Attackathon, Security researchers hunt the code based on specific rules
  to qualify for rewards. Only reports that are impactful as specified by the rules
  of the Attackathon, will be rewarded.


  After the Attackathon: Immunefi evaluates and compiles the results in the form of
  an official Attackathon report and spotlights top researchers with NFT awards and
  a leaderboard.


  The Attackathon aims to be the largest-ever crowdsourced security audit contest
  conducted to augment security for the entirety of the protocol’s code.


  Rationale


  The Ethereum Foundation has a permanent bug bounty, although it does not get the
  awareness and eyeballs it should get on the code.


  Running the largest audit contest now will help increase the security of the Ethereum
  protocol and upskill security researchers for contests at every hard fork in the
  future.


  Shared Codebase and Vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities in Ethereum could apply to
  the Gnosis Chain due to their shared codebase.

  Security Enhancements: Ethereum’s security improvements directly enhance the Gnosis
  Chain’s security boosting trust for Ethereum and Gnosis.

  Ecosystem: A secure Ethereum fosters a confident developer community, benefiting
  the Gnosis Chain

  Cost-Effective Security: Aligning with Ethereum’s security efforts provides high-quality
  assessments without bearing the total cost.

  Budget


  We seek to raise at least $2 million, with the EF contributing $500k. So far, a
  few projects have signed up to secure Ethereum.


  Based on feedback, we created a couple of tiers, although a project can be sponsored
  with any amount they wish.

  Evaluation


  The reports will be triaged by the Immunefi team and judged by EF and client team
  security researchers.


  Any unused funds will roll over to future audit contests and security research.


  I look forward to hearing from the Gnosis community on helping secure the Ethereum
  protocol.'
