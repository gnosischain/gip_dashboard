  \ Summary\n\nSwitch to Recovery-enabled GuardedSafes for all GIPs funded by the\
  \ DAO to increase project accountability and continued communication with the community.\n\
  \n####  Terminology used\n\n  1. **GIP-Guard** : A Transaction Guard designed for\
  \ specific GIPs.\n\n  2. **Milestone Payout Guard** : A GIP-Guard that only lets\
  \ transactions be processed from a Safe if the defined milestones have been met.\n\
  \n  3. **GuardedSafe** : A Safe with GIP-Guard added to it.\n\n  4. **Recovery-enabled\
  \ GuardedSafe** : A GuardedSafe with a recovery module added to it allowing GnosisDAO\
  \ to recover funds if they feel the team is underperforming.\n\n\n\n\n####  Introduction\n\
  \nGIPs have been instrumental in Gnosis ecosystem growth. Most GIPs are funded upfront\
  \ however, there is limited information available after funding. Milestones are\
  \ untracked, project updates are sparse and their status is unknown. There is no\
  \ easy way to analyse the impact of the project, learn from them, or know if the\
  \ project is still active. Moreover, if the team becomes unresponsive, the funded\
  \ amount sits idle in their wallet with no way to recover for the DAO.\n\nSome examples\
  \ of this we have seen are:\n\n  1. GIP-61: Bootnode received $580k to contribute\
  \ to the development and maintenance of bridges in the Gnosis ecosystem, Circles\
  \ Infrastructure, Running Gnosis beacon chain validators, and long-term DAO growth.\
  \ They promised bi-weekly status updates and reports on project progress. However,\
  \ over the last 8 months, only 1 update has been provided.\n  2. GIP-18: Tick-DAO\
  \ received $750k from Gnosis DAO. There have been no updates to the community after\
  \ the proposal has passed. The project even changed its name to Quiver Alpha, with\
  \ no updates to the Gnosis community.\n\n\n\nBeing a GIP with multiple scopes of\
  \ work there needs to be more transparency in how the funds are being used, milestone\
  \ progress and how far the roadmap has been executed.\n\n####  Proposed Changes\n\
  \nWe propose transitioning to **Recovery-enabled GuardedSafes** for all GIPs funded\
  \ by the DAO. These on-chain financial controllers have a **Milestone Payout Guard**\
  \ that only lets transactions be processed from the Safe if the defined milestones\
  \ have been met.\n\nFor each GIP, the community along with the builder team decides\
  \ on certain milestones that need to be met by a particular point in time. For each\
  \ of these milestones, the community appoints some milestone reviewers. These reviewers\
  \ will be responsible for verifying the status of the pre-defined milestones. If\
  \ the milestones are met, the reviewers mark the milestone as completed. Now, only\
  \ when all reviewers mark a milestone as completed can transactions from the Safe\
  \ be processed. In all others cases, it will revert.\n\n####  Impact and Benefits\n\
  \nSince the GIP has milestones already defined in the proposal, this **Milestone\
  \ Payout Guard** would ensure that the community is informed and the project is\
  \ motivated to stay on track. These milestones can be as subjective and tailored\
  \ to each project. It could include community calls, writing blogs or conducting\
  \ workshops could be set.\n\nWith **Recovery-enabled GuardedSafes** , the GnosisDAO\
  \ could recover funds upwards of $500k after seeing that the project was dormant\
  \ and lacked progress.\n\nThese **GuardedSafes** nudge projects with funds to keep\
  \ moving in the right direction while ensuring the community has some control if\
  \ things donâ€™t go according to plan.\n\n####  Implementation Plan\n\nDuring the\
  \ proposal discussion (Phase 2), the exact milestones and rubrics need to be ratified,\
  \ following which, a **Recovery-enabled GuardedSafe** will be created.\n\nThis includes\
  \ two aspects:\n\n  * **Milestone Payout Guard** : This is the **GIP-Guard** that\
  \ will be added to the Safe that the builder receives money in and lets the builder\
  \ withdraw funds from the Safe only if they meet the milestones set earlier. The\
  \ milestones completion will be checked by a set of reviewers as explained above.\n\
  \  * **Recovery Module** : This module will also be added to the same Safe and will\
  \ grant GnosisDAO some admin privileges. It will let the DAO recover funds without\
  \ needing the signatures from the Safe owners in case the team goes dormant or abandons\
  \ the project and stops building.\n\n\n\nWe propose all GIPs going forward receive\
  \ funds through **Recovery-enabled GuardedSafes**.\n\nSafeGuard will provide technical\
  \ support or assistance when needed. We will also work with the community on fine-tuning\
  \ the Guard to each proposal.\n\n####  Risks and Challenges\n\nThe main challenge\
  \ with GIP-Guards is to ensure that the guards work properly under all circumstances.\
  \ Transaction guards are smart contracts too and when dealing with financial matters,\
  \ it is of utmost importance that the contracts are secure. Hence, all of the GIP-Guards\
  \ will be throughly audited and only used after multiple rounds of testing.\n\n\
  ####  Team/ Organization/References\n\nSafeGuard was one of the winners at ETH India\
  \ and is incubated and developed by Questbook.\n\nQuestbook is a grant orchestration\
  \ tool being used by Compound, Polygon, Optimism and Aave to disburse more than\
  \ $3mn in grants. The team has also built Open Quest and Zero Wallet.\n\n1 Like\n"
