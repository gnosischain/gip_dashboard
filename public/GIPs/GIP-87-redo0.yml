title: Should GnosisDAO claim its vested GEL allocation and delegate it along with
  COW to governance Safe managed by karpatkey?
body: "## Summary\nThis proposal triggers the Gnosis DAO Safe to claim the fully vested\
  \ GEL tokens from Gelato and then delegate the voting power of GEL and COW to the\
  \ governance Safe managed by karpatkey following GIP-58.\n\n## Motivation\n####\
  \ GEL\nFollowing Gelato’s community vote on accelerating the GEL vesting 1, GEL\
  \ tokens have been fully vested on the Gnosis DAO since the 27th of February, 2023.\n\
  \nHowever, these tokens are not being put to any use in the Gnosis ecosystem. By\
  \ enabling the Gnosis DAO to claim the vested GEL tokens and delegate their voting\
  \ power to the karpatkey’s governance Safe, we can ensure that these tokens are\
  \ contributing to shape the future of Gelato.\n\nkarpatkey has been managing the\
  \ Gnosis DAO treasury since GIP-20, having later extended the range of services\
  \ through GIP-58. Through our strong relationship with Gnosis DAO, we can actively\
  \ manage the voting power of GEL to benefit the Gnosis DAO. The complete amount\
  \ vested to Gnosis DAO is 5,258,625 GEL—and these are not intended to be sold.\n\
  \nThe claimable GEL amount would put Gnosis DAO in 9th place 3 of the current GEL\
  \ holders.\n\n#### COW\nFurthermore, the Gnosis DAO has access to 48.5MM COW voting\
  \ power on CoW DAO. This voting power consists of 47472327.585 vCOW and 1027672.415\
  \ COW.\n\nFor vCOW, Gnosis DAO currently has the second largest share of 14.35%,\
  \ and for COW, Gnosis DAO holds 0.1028% of the current circulating supply.\n\nkarpatkey\
  \ can also vote on the Gnosis DAO’s behalf and ensure the mutually beneficial growth\
  \ of both Gnosis DAO and CoW DAO as karpatkey has been working together with CoW\
  \ DAO since the creation of the Core Treasury Team (CIP-19 1).\n\n## Specification\n\
  The proposal includes the following steps:\n\nClaim first batch of vested GEL token:\
  \ 2,629,312 GEL\nClaim second batch of vested GEL token: 2,629,312 GEL\nDelegate\
  \ the voting power for GEL on Snapshot to karpatkey’s governance Safe eth:0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52\n\
  Delegate the voting power for COW on Snapshot to karpatkey’s governance Safe eth:0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52\n\
  \n## Implementation\nThe snapshot vote, if successful, will trigger two claims on\
  \ Gelato Governance Dashboard 4 and then delegate the voting power of GEL and COW\
  \ on snapshot to eth:0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52, karpatkey’s governance\
  \ Safe.\n\n- Proposed .json for Snapshot:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"to\": \"0x4A7c7652aBd5E5e3467C458E42493630AAA7DDD6\"\
