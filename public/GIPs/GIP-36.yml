title: Should GnosisDAO fund BuidlGuidl 3 ETH per quarter?
body: 'The BuidlGuidl is a curated group of Ethereum builders creating prototypes
  and tutorials to enrich the ecosystem. They actively maintain scaffold-eth. Austin
  Griffith and BuidlGuidl can be a source of new talent for the Gnosis ecosystem.
  We can think of new quests to add, which might lead to new hires for Safe, CowSwap,
  or Gnosis Chain projects.


  This GIP proposes to fund BuidlGuidl with 3 ETH per quarter sent to buidlguidl.eth
  from the GnosisDAO treasury.'
