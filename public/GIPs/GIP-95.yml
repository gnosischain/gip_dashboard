title: karpatkey DAO Service Extension
body: 'After the approval of GIP-20 4 and GIP-58 5, at karpatkey DAO we have been
  working steadily on the management of GnosisDAO’s treasury. Similar to other treasuries
  we manage, we have seen the interest of DAOs to diversify their treasuries by adding
  exposure to real world assets (“RWA”) as well as interacting with real world entities
  for services in the interest of GnosisDAO.


  We therefore propose that the scope of the treasury management services as carried
  out presently, be expanded to cater for the possibility to invest in RWA.'
