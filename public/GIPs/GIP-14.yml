title: Gnosis vault on Hats.finance
body: "##  Simple Summary\n\nFollowing the previous forum post, a proposal is to create\
  \ a Gnosis security vault on Hats.finance. Security Vaults on Hats incentivizes\
  \ hackers, auditors, and the community to protect the projects and protocols contracts\
  \ by promoting responsible disclosure.\n\n  * A committee composed of Gnosis dev\
  \ leadership & security auditors is assigned as reviewers for security disclosures.\n\
  \n  * A Gnosis vault is initialized on Hats.finance protocol, with defined severities,\
  \ covered smart contracts list.\n\n  * Community members, Gnosis Treasury, and the\
  \ broad ecosystem are incentivized to deposit GNO into the vault.\n\n  * The goal\
  \ of the vault is to incentivize responsible disclosure in the case of a detected\
  \ hack or exploit.\n\n  * The dApp is live **app.hats.finance**\n\n\n\n\n##  Abstract\n\
  \nHats.finance is a proactive bounty protocol for white hat hackers and auditors,\
  \ where projects, community members, and stakeholders incentivize protocol security\
  \ and responsible disclosure.\n\nHats create scalable vaults using the project’s\
  \ own token. The value of the bounty increases with the success of the token and\
  \ project. In addition, NFT artists will create numerous unique NFTs specially minted\
  \ for hackers and auditors that will responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.\n\nWe\
  \ offer every participant in the Ethereum ecosystem skin in the game to ensure a\
  \ more secure future for the users of #Ethereum and smart contracts in general.\n\
  \n##  Motivation\n\nGnosis project:\n\n  * 24/7 audit on your protocol with a proactive\
  \ approach that incentivizes the hacker to disclose the vulnerability instead of\
  \ exploiting it.\n\n  * A disclosed vulnerability means no TVL/ TOKEN and, most\
  \ of all, no reputation loss.\n\n  * PR of disclosure and fix becomes a strength\
  \ to the project and its development team.\n\n  * Attract more users to the “strong\
  \ and secure protocol.”\n\n  * Permissionless vault - token holders and the gnosis\
  \ community can deposit or withdraw in the same permissionless nature.\n\n\n\n\n\
  GNO value:\n\n  * GNO staked in Hats vault increases Gnosis security guarantees\n\
  \n  * Staking GNO in the hat vaults reduces circulating token supply\n\n  * One-sided\
  \ yield farming based on your GNO\n\n  * Participating in Hats pull at this initial\
  \ phase will be rewarded with extra allocation points(Extra token incentive for\
  \ the first 20 projects to join). This way, the gnosis community will have extra\
  \ voting power in what could become a significant security layer of the ecosystem.\n\
  \n\n\n\nGnosis community / GNO holders:\n\n  * Join the effort to secure the ecosystem.\n\
  \n  * Financial incentive in the form of Yield farming (Protocol protection mining)\n\
  \n  * Protect their own project token by sacrificing a portion of their token to\
  \ make their holding more secure. By doing that, get $HAT and become influential\
  \ in the Hats governance process.\n\n\n\n\n##  Specification\n\nThe hats protocol\
  \ is permissionless, meaning anyone can participate and lock GNO in the Hats GNO\
  \ vault. The GNO vault protects the Gnosis protocol from hacks by incentivizing\
  \ responsible disclosure through the Hats protocol.\n\nIf a hacker responsibly discloses\
  \ an exploit through the Hats mechanism, a portion (depending on severity) of the\
  \ locked GNO tokens will go to the hacker as a reward, some vested, and some immediately.\n\
  \nThis is a win-win situation for Hackers, the Gnosis community, and the core team.\n\
  \nAs a GNO holder: Statistically when a protocol suffers a hack or exploit its token\
  \ value will drop between 35-50% at the 24 hours following the hack (Messari). It\
  \ is rational to lock part of a user’s holdings to protect the rest of his holdings\
  \ from a potential hack.\n\nHacker gets a substantial amount of _FUNGIBLE_ money,\
  \ become famous for disclosing a critical vulnerability instead of rekt’ing the\
  \ protocol and its stakeholders, and receive funds without becoming a worldwide\
  \ criminal.\n\nWe found out that a crucial element that can help black hat hackers\
  \ to participate in protocol protection is privacy and permissionless.\n\nThe decentralization\
  \ of the protocol is critical in order to incentivize anyone involved in the protocols\
  \ to protect it: community, artist, investors, team members, & developers.\n\n##\
  \  Rationale\n\nSecurity underlies the technology of smart contracts, there isn’t\
  \ such a thing as too much security. We think Ethereum dapps should include both\
  \ our solution and others. The beauty of Hats being a fully permissionless protocol\
  \ is that DAOs, treasuries, and individuals can deposit or withdraw funds from the\
  \ vault at any point. Utilize Idle funds for active protection with full depositor\
  \ control for treasuries and users alike.\n\nThe Hats contracts are [public](https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts)\
  \ verified on Etherscan and can be found by clicking the “View Contracts Covered”\
  \ under Hats vault in app.hats.finance and we are ready to onboard Gnosis GNO.\n\
  \nAudit and safety measures:\n\n[Audit reports](https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts/tree/develop/audit)\n\
  \nHats is live with Hats vault containing $100K USDC worth of token to incentivize\
  \ responsible disclosure.\n\nVault funding: **Not part of this GIP**\n\nThe amount\
  \ of Funding the Gnosis vault on hats, by $GNO holders and Gnosis DAO is 100% controlled\
  \ by you. As a community, you can choose together how important it is for you to\
  \ incentivize others to make Gnosis a much safer environment. Bear in mind that\
  \ funds will be released from the vault only due to vulnerability disclosure. The\
  \ upside from fixing issues is drastically more valuable than the financial face\
  \ value of the GNO tokens that are going to be deposited.\n\n##  Implementation\n\
  \n  * The hats team will create the committee set up JSON file with all the open-source\
  \ details we collected online.\n  * Gnosis team for confirmation.\n  * When this\
  \ stage is completed, the vault will be displayed in hats dApp.\n\n\n\n##  Gnosis\
