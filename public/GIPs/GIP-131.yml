title: Should Gnosis DAO continue and update the Gnosis Pay Cashback Programme? -
  Governance - Gnosis
body: "## Summary\n\nThis proposal continues and updates the cashback programme approved\
  \ under GIP-110, introducing higher reward rates, progressive weekly spend caps\
  \ tied to GNO holdings, and stronger anti-gaming measures. The goal is to drive\
  \ Gnosis Pay card usage, incentivize GNO holding, and ensure long-term sustainability.\n\
  \n## Key updates:\n\n  * Higher maximum cashback: increased from 4% up to 8%, plus\
  \ +1% for OG NFT holders (9% max)\n  * Maximum GNO holding eligible for rewards\
  \ increased from 100 GNO to 1,000 GNO\n  * Weekly eligible spend now scales with\
  \ GNO holdings, capped at USD 2500 equivalent for the largest holders\n  * Budget:\
  \ 5,000 GNO\n  * Estimated budget duration: Based on current transaction volumes\
  \ and the updated cashback model, the budget is expected to last 5–8 months.\n \
  \ * Updated terms to close loopholes and block bad actors\n\n\n\nAverage GNO holding\
  \ for 7 days | Cashback rate | Max Eligible Weekly Spend  \n---|---|---  \n0.10\
  \ | 1.00% | $200  \n0.50 | 1.70% | $235  \n1.00 | 2.00% | $250  \n5.00 | 2.70% |\
  \ $337  \n10.00 | 3.00% | $375  \n20.00 | 3.30% | $488  \n50.00 | 3.70% | $637 \
  \ \n100.00 | 4.00% | $750  \n200.00 | 5.20% | $1,277  \n500.00 | 6.80% | $1,973\
  \  \n1,000.00 | 8.00% | $2,500  \n  \n## Rationale\n\nThe cashback programme launched\
  \ under GIP-110 successfully boosted Gnosis Pay adoption, but analysis showed:\n\
  \n  * A small number of users made disproportionately high spending to maximise\
  \ cashback (“gaming” behaviour)\n  * A large share of rewards went to these outliers,\
  \ reducing fairness and ROI.\n\n\n\nGIP-131 addresses these issues by:\n\n  * Linking\
  \ weekly eligible spend to GNO holdings via a logarithmic scaling formula\n  * Increasing\
  \ reward rates for sustained, higher GNO holdings\n  * Replacing the flat weekly\
  \ cap with progressive caps\n  * Tightening anti-manipulation rules to block manufactured\
  \ spend and self-funding\n\n\n\nExpected results:\n\n  * Fairer reward distribution\
  \ across more genuine users\n  * Longer budget lifespan, benefiting more participants\n\
  \  * Stronger GNO demand through higher holding incentives\n\n\n\n## Continuation\
  \ of GIP-110\n\nThis is a direct continuation of the programme established under\
  \ GIP-110 , with changes based on performance analysis, and community feedback and\
  \ inspiration taken by another proposal to adjust the cashback programme GIP-125.\
  \ All unchanged terms from GIP-110 remain in effect unless updated here.\n\nBased\
  \ on current transaction volumes and the updated cashback model, we estimate the\
  \ programme budget will last approximately 5–8 months. During this period, we will\
  \ continue to design a long-term, more sustainable loyalty rewards mechanism, planned\
  \ to align with the launch of the Gnosis Wallet as outlined in GIP-128.\n\n## Implementation\n\
  \n  * Cashback rate: Scales continuously with the lowest GNO holding in the 7-day\
  \ snapshot period, up to 8% base or 9% with OG NFT bonus\n  * Weekly spend cap:\
  \ Varies with GNO holdings, up to USD 2500 equivalent\n  * The eligible spend cap\
  \ is applied on a weekly basis, aligned with the weekly reward distribution schedule.\
  \ Unused eligible spend does not roll over to future weeks.\n  * Distribution: Weekly\
  \ (5–12 days after payment) in GNO on Gnosis Chain using Chainlink/Chronicle FX\
  \ rates\n  * Administration: Operated by kpk on behalf of the Gnosis DAO Operational\
  \ Foundation\n\n\n\n## Budget\n\n  * Total: 5,000 GNO\n  * Runs until budget depletion\
  \ or DAO decision to terminate or replace with a new reward model\n\n\n\n## Anti-Gaming\
  \ Measures\n\nIneligible Transactions & Behaviours\n\n  * ATM withdrawals – cash\
  \ withdrawals do not earn cashback.\n  * Bank account top-ups – loading bank accounts\
  \ via the card is excluded.\n  * Refund cycling – making purchases and refunding\
  \ them to generate rewards.\n  * Merchant self-payments – paying yourself or an\
  \ associated merchant.\n  * Self-funding & merchant collusion – coordinated spending\
  \ to inflate rewards.\n  * Rapid repeat transactions – multiple payments to the\
  \ same merchant in a short period.\n  * Automated or scripted transactions – using\
  \ bots or scripts to trigger payments.\n  * Suspicious or abnormal activity – spending\
  \ patterns inconsistent with genuine use.\n  * GNO top-ups immediately before spending\
  \ without sustained holding.\n\n\n\nPenalties\n\n  * Disqualification from the current\
  \ cashback programme.\n  * Blacklisting from all future GnosisDAO-funded incentive\
  \ programmes.\n\n\n\n# GNO Cashback Offer Rules (“Official Rules”)\n\nSponsored,\
  \ Administered, and Operated by:  \nThe GNO Cashback Program (“Offer”) is sponsored\
  \ by GnosisDAO (“Sponsor”), offered and administered by the Gnosis DAO Operational\
  \ Foundation (“Administrator”), and operated by kpk(“Operator”) in accordance with\
  \ its mandate from the Sponsor.\n\n## 1\\. Eligibility\n\nThe Offer is only open\
  \ to Gnosis Pay account holders who have:\n\n  * an Operational Account; and\n \
  \ * are in compliance with the Gnosis Pay terms and conditions available here: Gnosis\
  \ Pay WebApp Terms of Service | Gnosis Pay Legal 14, which includes compliance with\
  \ the applicable cardholder terms, which are here 15 for the UK+Switzerland and\
  \ here 16 for the EEA (“User”).\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of these terms, an “Operational\
  \ Account” means a Gnosis Pay account (including the card) which has not been frozen,\
  \ suspended, closed, deactivated or terminated. Users must meet the eligibility\
  \ criteria up to and including the date of distribution of any GNO Reward (as defined\
  \ below). Failure to meet the eligibility requirements prior to the distribution\
  \ of any GNO Reward will mean the User is not eligible and will not receive any\
  \ GNO Reward.\n\n## 2\\. Acceptance of Rules\n\nBy Opting In (as defined below)\
  \ or otherwise participating in the Offer, each User:\n\n  * (a) agrees to be bound\
  \ by these Official Rules and by the interpretation of these Official Rules by the\
  \ Administrator and by the decisions of the Administrator, which are final and binding\
  \ in all respects;\n  * (b) acknowledges compliance with these Official Rules; and\n\
  \  * (c) agrees to comply with any and all applicable federal, state and local laws,\
  \ rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nReceiving any Cashback (as defined below) is contingent\
  \ upon fulfilling all requirements set forth in these Official Rules.\n\n  3. Offer\
  \ Term; Snapshot Period\n\n\n\nThe Offer begins and ends at the times and dates\
  \ specified by the GIP-131 proposal or, if earlier, shall end as soon as there are\
  \ no more funds in the Cashback Reward Pool (as defined below), or as may be further\
  \ specified by the Operator, in its absolute and final discretion (“Offer Period”).\n\
  \nThe “Snapshot Period” is the seven (7) days preceding a Card Payment (as defined\
  \ below).\n\n  4. Method of Participation\n\n\n\nTo participate in the Offer, a\
  \ User must satisfy the eligibility criteria set out above, and meet the below requirements:\n\
  \n  * Opt in via Gnosis Pay Web App as directed on the UI;\n  * Have or hold at\
  \ least 0.1 GNO tokens in their Gnosis Pay Safe throughout the Snapshot Period (“GNO\
  \ Holding”); and\n  * Make a payment (excepting any ATM withdrawals or Payment Manipulation)\
  \ from the User’s Gnosis Pay card (“Card Payment”), up to a maximum eligible weekly\
  \ spend amount that scales with GNO holdings using the GIP-131 logarithmic model,\
  \ with a maximum cap of USD 10,000 equivalent (as applicable to the User).\n\n\n\
  \nUsers can decide to opt out of the Offer at any point by transferring out their\
  \ GNO tokens from their Gnosis Pay Safe or reducing their GNO Holding to less than\
  \ 0.1 GNO.\n\nAny GNO obtained through bad trading practices, including but not\
  \ limited to wash trades, false trading, self-dealing, or trades that display any\
  \ attributes of manipulation (“GNO Top-Up Manipulation”) will not be counted towards\
  \ the GNO Holding of the User.\n\nAny card payments, or activities in relation to\
  \ the Offer, that constitute manufactured spending, refund cycling, account churning,\
  \ misleading purchases, cooperation with merchants, self-funding, multiple or rapid\
  \ repeated transactions with the same merchant in a short time frame, automated\
  \ or scripted transactions, patterns indicative of fraud or abuse, or any other\
  \ conduct that displays attributes of an attempt to game or manipulate the Offer\
  \ (“Payment Manipulation”) will not be counted towards the Card Payment amounts\
  \ of the User.\n\nAny person engaging in GNO Top-Up Manipulation, Payment Manipulation,\
  \ or otherwise trying to game, exploit, maliciously manipulate the Offer (“Offer\
  \ Manipulation”) to increase their rewards or reduce anyone else’s will not receive\
  \ the GNO Rewards and will be blacklisted from any future participation in this\
  \ Offer and any future reward program sponsored by GnosisDAO, in Operator’s sole\
  \ and absolute discretion.\n\n  5. Cashback\n\n\n\nThe total Cashback reward pool\
  \ is 5,000 GNO (“Cashback Reward Pool”).\n\nUsers will only receive Cashback:  \n\
  (i) provided that the User is still satisfying the eligibility criteria set out\
  \ in section 1 above at the time of the distribution;  \n(ii) so long as and to\
  \ the extent that there are still funds available in the Cashback Reward Pool will\
  \ Users receive any Cashback; and  \n(iii) calculated against their Card Payments\
  \ up to the Maximum Eligible Payments for their GNO holding level, beyond which\
  \ there would be no further Cashback for Card Payments in that month.\n\nCashback\
  \ will be distributed in accordance with the below:\n\nAverage GNO holding for 7\
  \ days | Cashback rate | Max Eligible Weekly Spend  \n---|---|---  \n0.10 | 1.00%\
  \ | $200  \n0.50 | 1.70% | $235  \n1.00 | 2.00% | $250  \n5.00 | 2.70% | $337  \n\
  10.00 | 3.00% | $375  \n20.00 | 3.30% | $488  \n50.00 | 3.70% | $637  \n100.00 |\
  \ 4.00% | $750  \n200.00 | 5.20% | $1,277  \n500.00 | 6.80% | $1,973  \n1,000.00\
  \ | 8.00% | $2,500  \n  \nThe cashback percentage scales continuously within the\
  \ model, meaning, for example, that if a User’s lowest GNO Holding through the Snapshot\
  \ Period was 5.5 GNO, then their relevant Base Cashback would be determined according\
  \ to the scaling formula.\n\nUsers holding a Gnosis Pay OG NFT in their Gnosis Pay\
  \ SAFE (“OG Holders”) will receive an additional 1% on the Base Cashback (“OG Bonus”,\
  \ which together with the Base Cashback is referred to as “Cashback”), hence their\
  \ total Cashback would be Base Cashback +1%, up to a 9% cap.\n\n## 6\\. Distribution\
  \ of Cashback\n\nThe Cashback rewards will be automatically distributed in GNO tokens\
  \ on Gnosis Chain to the User’s Gnosis Pay Safe (“GNO Reward”), on a weekly basis,\
  \ 5–12 days after the relevant Card Payment.\n\nGNO Rewards will be calculated in\
  \ the currency of the Card Payment using the Chainlink (or Chronicle for GBP) price\
  \ feed for GNO/USD, EUR/USD or GBP/USD at the time of distribution of the Cashback\
  \ to the User.\n\nAny User who is reasonably found to be either failing to meet\
  \ the Offer eligibility criteria or who is engaging in or attempting to engage in\
  \ Offer Manipulation will not be sent any GNO Reward, and may suffer the consequences\
  \ further set out in section 4 above. ANY VIOLATION OF THESE OFFICIAL RULES BY USER\
  \ WILL RESULT IN SUCH USER’S DISQUALIFICATION FROM RECEIVING ANY GNO REWARD AND\
  \ ALL PRIVILEGES AS A USER UNDER THIS OFFER WILL BE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED. ANY\
  \ ATTEMPT BY ANY PERSON TO DELIBERATELY DAMAGE OR UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION\
  \ OF THE OFFER MAY BE IN VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAW AND SHOULD SUCH AN\
  \ ATTEMPT BE MADE, THE SPONSOR, THE ADMINISTRATOR, AND THE OPERATOR RESERVE THE\
  \ RIGHT TO SEEK REMEDIES AND DAMAGES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES) FROM ANY SUCH PERSON\
  \ TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\n  7. Refunds\n\n\n\nIf a User receives\
  \ a refund on a Card Payment, any GNO Rewards will be suspended until the total\
  \ amount of Cashback corresponding to the refunded amount has been offset. This\
  \ means that the User will not receive any new GNO Rewards until the value of the\
  \ Cashback from the refunded amount has been fully accounted for by new Cashback\
  \ calculations on eligible Card Payments. This is without limitation to any measures\
  \ the Operator may take against the User if the User is found to be engaging in\
  \ Offer Manipulation.\n\n## 8\\. Limitation of Liability\n\nTHE CASHBACK IS OFFERED\
  \ AND PROVIDED “AS IS” WITH NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE BY THE SPONSOR OR ANY OF ITS\
  \ RELATED ENTITIES, OR THE ADMINISTRATOR, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. IN NO EVENT\
  \ WILL THE SPONSOR OR ANY OF ITS RELATED ENTITIES, THE ADMINISTRATOR OR OPERATOR\
  \ BE LIABLE TO ANY USER FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE\
  \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS OR PROFITS) ARISING\
  \ OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH A USER’S PARTICIPATION IN THE OFFER, WHETHER SUCH\
  \ LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING\
  \ NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE SPONSOR OR\
  \ ANY OF ITS RELATED ENTITIES, THE ADMINISTRATOR, OR THE OPERATOR HAVE BEEN ADVISED\
  \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.\n\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\
  \ THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,\
  \ SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO USERS IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS.\n\
  \n## 9\\. Indemnification\n\nBy participating in the Offer, each User agrees to\
  \ indemnify, defend, and hold harmless, the Sponsor and any of its related entities,\
  \ the Administrator, and the Operator from any and all liability, for any claims,\
  \ damages, injuries or losses of any kind, and to release all rights to bring any\
  \ claim, action or proceeding arising out of, in connection with, or relating to\
  \ participation in the Offer or receipt of any GNO Reward. Each User assumes all\
  \ liability for any injury or damage caused, or claimed to be caused, by participation\
  \ in the Offer, or the acceptance, receipt, or use of the GNO Reward or any Cashback\
  \ component. Each User further agrees that in any cause of action, the Sponsor or\
  \ any of its related entities, the Administrator, and the Operator’s liability will\
  \ be limited to the value of the GNO Rewards distributed to the User during this\
  \ particular Offer, and in no event shall the Sponsor or any of its related entities,\
  \ the Administrator, or the Operator be liable for attorney’s fees.\n\n## 10\\.\
  \ No Assumption of Responsibility; Force Majeure\n\nThe Sponsor and any of its related\
  \ entities, the Administrator, and the Operator are not responsible if the Offer\
  \ cannot take place or is delayed, or if the GNO Reward cannot be distributed or\
  \ is delayed, interrupted or fails due to acts of God, war, natural disasters, weather,\
  \ acts or threats of terrorism, strikes, lockouts, labor disputes, work stoppages,\
  \ fire, acts of government, or other events outside of the reasonable control of\
  \ the Sponsor and any of its related entities and of the Administrator and Operator.\n\
