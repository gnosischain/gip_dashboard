title: Should GnosisDAO retroactively fund POKT-powered Public RPC endpoints for Gnosis
  Chain pruned and Gnosis Chain archival?
body: "https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-75-should-gnosisdao-retroactively-fund-pokt-powered-public-rpc-endpoints-for-gnosis-chain-pruned-and-gnosis-chain-archival/6363\n\
  \nSummary\n\nPocket Network is a decentralized, middleware protocol focused on the\
  \ RPC layer. Our goal is to provide blockchain application developers with a privacy-preserving,\
  \ multi-chain gateway on top of the Pocket Network protocol that allows dapp developers\
  \ to mint reliable, fast RPC endpoints for the 40+ blockchain networks supported,\
  \ including both Gnosis Chain pruned and Gnosis Chain archival.\n\nOver the last\
  \ month, Gnosis Chain has carved the number 2 spot in terms of requests per day\
  \ at 195M daily avgerage requests according to POKTscan!\n\nAbstract\n\nBy sponsoring\
  \ a pokt-powered Public Gnosis Chain RPC endpoint, GnosisDAO and Pocket Network\
  \ would continue to contribute to the decentralization, increased resiliency, and\
  \ censorship-resistance of the Gnosis Chain network. All the while, continuing to\
  \ incentivize Gnosis Chain node runners with $POKT tokens for serving Gnosis dapps.\n\
  \nPublic RPCs are a public good, we hope to share in the responsibility together\
  \ with the GnosisDAO of maintaining these high-quality public goods on behalf of\
  \ Gnosis Chain users. The Pocket Network team and community have been a long-time\
  \ supporters of the Gnosis Chain.\n\nWe’re proud to continue supporting Gnosis!\n\
  \nMotivation\n\nThe current set of Gnosis Relay Chain IDs (RCIs) we suport are:\n\
  \nGnosis Chain = 0027 (mainnet)\nGnosis Chain Archival = 000C (mainnet)\n\nThe POKTdao\
  \ allowlisted Gnosis Chain (0027) on 07/06/21, with Gnosis Chain Archival (000C)\
  \ shortly after on 08/26/21). Since the allowlist date, Pocket node operators earned\
  \ 55.6M POKT from servicing over 38.9B Gnosis Chain mainnet read/write requests.\
  \ \n\nSee this spreadsheet for a breakdown of relays drive and POKT earned:\n\n\
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13q-hebfwWOCeQbWGuAeclOyu5MQk-m-YHot60Kjd94I/edit?usp=sharing\n\
  \nOver that time, these Gnosis RCIs developed to become one of the more populated,\
  \ stable, and higher-performant pools of nodes. Our network of node runners easily\
  \ handled several spikes, including a big spike to 243.6M requests on a single day\
  \ recently in JAN 2023.\n\nAccording to POKTscan, there are currently 22,379 Pocket\
  \ Service Nodes pointing to Gnosis Full Nodes for the 0027 Relay Chain ID and 2,561\
  \ Pocket Service Nodes pointing to Gnosis Archive Nodes for the 000C Relay Chain\
  \ ID. This demonstrates the POKT node incentives at work!\n\nThe POKTdao supported\
  \ node deployment solutions through funding grants such as Node Pilot and DappNode\
  \ to make it super easy to spin up and monetize Gnosis full/archival nodes within\
  \ the Pocket Network protocol.\n\nRationale\n\nPocket Network Inc. staked POKT on\
  \ behalf of the GnosisDAO to subsizie a public good in the form of public RPC endpoints\
  \ (available in the Gnosis Chain docs) without rate limits:\n\nhttps://gnosischain-rpc.gateway.pokt.network\n\
  https://gnosischain-archival-rpc.gateway.pokt.network\n\nWe’ve simplified our model\
  \ this year to mirror a traditional SaaS-like tiered structure, which is much more\
  \ affordable. To sweeten the deal, we are offering the Gnosis DAO team and community\
  \ a massive discount on a 200M requests per day throughput on a 1-year commitment\
  \ with the option to renew on an annual basis:\n\n$135,997 USD for 200M Requests\
  \ Per Day on a 1-year Contract (i.e. next 12 months)\n\nThat represents 4.8x in\
  \ savings (a 480% discount) compared to the original offer!\n\nIn case a buffer\
  \ is wanted/needed, as traffic continues to grow, we’d like to extend another option\
  \ to purchase additional bandwidth at the discounted price of $0.0000018640 per\
  \ request throughout the contract period.\n\nPublic RPCs are a public good, we hope\
  \ to share in the responsibility together with the GnosisDAO of maintaining these\
  \ high-quality public goods on behalf of Gnosis Chain users.\n\nThe GnosisDAO will\
  \ be able to monitor and manage the public RPCs through our Pocket Portal as they\
  \ see fit, including the ability to enable additional security features such as\
  \ allowlisting user-agents, origins, smart contracts, and methods.\n\nImplementation\
  \ (Completed)\n\nIn return, Pocket Network agrees to these milestones and deliverables:\n\
  \ \n![gip75 implementation.PNG](ipfs://bafkreidpfbqybahguw525twv2is43n5uytgqa6tp53fqdbpevf5rubarl4)\n\
  \    \nIf we are unsuccessful in our proposal to secure retroactive funding, PNI\
  \ will continue to support the Gnosis Chain network; however, in an effort to do\
  \ so sustainably, we would introduce per second rate limits on the Public RPC that\
  \ would channel users and developers to our paid tier in the Pocket Portal where\
  \ costs would be passed on directly to Gnosis builders outside the free tier of\
  \ 250k requests per day.\n\nPayment Schedule\n\nPayment Dates & Amount Due\nUpon\
  \ Proposal Passing 50% = $67,998.50 USD\nUpon Milestone Completion 50% = $67,998.50\
  \ USD\nTotal 100% = $135,997 USD\n\nPNI prefers payment in stablecoins, such as\
  \ USDC or DAI, at this provided address -> 0x5F1Feefc4BB7a414096cCF070BeEF94da8Ff88A6"
