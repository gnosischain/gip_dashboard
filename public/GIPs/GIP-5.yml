title: Remove Gnosis Impact from the GnosisDAO Governance Process
body: "See the Forum post for all details and discussion: https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-5-remove-gnosis-impact-from-the-gnosisdao-governance-process/1058\
  \ \n\nTl;dr\n\nGnosis Impact is currently an integral component of the Gnosis governance\
  \ process. The current implementation of Gnosis Impact has known flaws and poses\
  \ uncalled-for obstacles to pass proposals through the governance process. I therefore\
  \ propose to exclude the obligatory utilization of Gnosis Impact as part of the\
  \ GnosisDAO’s governance process phase 3 until a proposal passes amending its shortcomings.\n\
  \n\nThe Proposal\n\nThe GnosisDAO governance process currently consists of three\
  \ phases:\n1.    Informal discussion on Gnosis Forum regarding potential proposal\n\
  2.   Creation of a GIP in the Gnosis Forum, including a Forum poll\n3.   Creation\
  \ of proposal on Snapshot + creation of two prediction markets on Omen, with one\
  \ market collateralized in GNO and the other collateralized in a stablecoin + setting\
  \ up the Gnosis Impact plugin.\n\nAs described above, phase 3 of the GnosisDAO Governance\
  \ process is complex and cost intensive, making it less attractive and accessible\
  \ for individuals to move their proposal forward to the final and essential governance\
  \ stage that will decide on the implementation of a proposal.\n\nOther than the\
  \ complexity of setting up Gnosis Impact, the tool itself currently has a few inherent\
  \ flaws:\n- Due to Omen’s Fixed Product Market Maker (FPMM), all funds provided\
  \ to set up the prediction markets are lost: once it becomes clear how the vote\
  \ will turn out traders will buy all the winning tokens. This is making any proposal\
  \ very cost intensive.\n- As setting up Gnosis Impact is very capital intensive,\
  \ it is not worthwhile to process any proposal that involves less than $100k. \n\
  - Price impacts projected by Gnosis Impact are not very accurate as a) the market\
  \ prices for the outcome tokens can only be found as long as it is still open which\
  \ decision will be made on Snapshot and b) because potential profit opportunities\
  \ are debilitated by Omen fees and gas fees. \n\nOnly two proposals have so far\
  \ been processed through phase 3 since GnosisDAO went live in November of last year,\
  \ underlining the complexity of passing proposals through the final stage. Removing\
  \ Gnosis Impact as a mandatory step will make GnosisDAO’s governance process simpler\
  \ and economically viable and will allow more individuals to push their proposal\
  \ to the final stage of governance."
