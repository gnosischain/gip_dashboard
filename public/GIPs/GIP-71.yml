title: 'Should GnosisDAO support hosted Blockscout explorer for Chiado testnet? '
body: 'Chiado testnet is an important new part of the Gnosis ecosystem as a developer
  testnet. A reliable explorer is required for developers to be productive on Gnosis.
  A Blockscout instance should be set up as soon as possible to support Chiado now
  and into the future. This instance will rely on a dedicated node supported by Gateway.
  Gateway is already working with Chiado and can quickly spin up and support the required
  node infrastructure and RPC endpoint.


  To expedite the process, which is necessary as the merge is coming very quickly,
  we are proceeding directly to phase 2. In case this proposal is supported by Gnosis
  community, Blockscout team is ready to prioritize this integration, and will try
  to launch the instance within one month after passing the proposal. We’ll plan for
  minimal branding based on the current Gnosis Chain explorer with monochrome colors
  to differentiate Chiado. The instance will be hosted at https://blockscout.com/gnosis/chiado
  4.


  As detailed in GIP-54 1, costs for hosting additional instances are $50,000 annually
  and cover high-capacity bandwidth, infrastructure upgrades, and data storage for
  the network. Feature enhancements and priority support are also included.


  Payment should be made to BlockScout’s Ethereum mainnet 0xAddress 0x242ba6d68FfEb4a098B591B32d370F973FF882B7
  in $BOB tokens.'
