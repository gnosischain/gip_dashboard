  \    \n    \n    GIP: 76\n    Set up a legal entity controlled and owned by the\
  \ DAO?\n    author: Monika \n    status: Draft\n    type: Meta\n    created: 2023-01-20\n\
  \    \n\n##  **Simple Summary**\n\nThis is a proposal to set up a legal entity (in\
  \ the form of an LLC) owned by a Gnosis DAO wallet that enables the GnosisDAO to\
  \ interact with business partners with an incorporated entity.\n\n##  **Abstract**\n\
  \nThis new legal entity:  \n● Can enter into contractual arrangements on behalf\
  \ of the GnosisDAO  \n● Can make payments to different service providers that are\
  \ undertaking  \nservices on behalf of the GnosisDAO  \n● Can hold assets/digital\
  \ property such as patents, copyrights or trademarks  \n● Is not owned by a physical\
  \ person nor an official representing the company,  \ninstead the legal entity is\
  \ owned by a smart contract address that is  \ncontrolled by the GnosisDAO\n\n##\
  \  **Motivation**\n\nThe GnosisDAO is the decentralized collective steward of the\
  \ Gnosis ecosystem. It is participant managed, and does not have any director or\
  \ manager. No single party is in control. As the GnosisDAO exists entirely on-chain,\
  \ it is not always recognised as an entity with legal personality or limited liability.\
  \ Some maintain that an unincorporated DAO cannot enter into contracts with outside\
  \ entities, hold bank accounts or assets, or make cash payments. In order to be\
  \ able to function in the web2 world, we can create an associated legal entity owned\
  \ by a smart contract address that is controlled by the GnosisDAO.\n\n##  **Specification**\n\
  \nTogether with OtoCo (see OtoCo - Automated Company Assembly on Blockchain) it\
  \ is possible to create an LLC in Wyoming with a member that is neither a physical\
  \ person nor an official representing a company. Instead, the member can be a smart\
  \ contract address.  \nThis is achieved through a so-called Series LLC. A Series\
  \ has a Master and individual Series. Each Series is considered an LLC in its own\
  \ right, with its own name and its own Member(s) independent from the Members of\
  \ the Master LLC and other Series’ Members. Individual Series need a first Member.\
  \ The first Member of a Series LLC can be a smart contract address, using the OtoCo\
  \ company assembly smart contract.  \nEach Series LLC is represented by an NFT minted\
  \ by the OtoCo Master contract. Company information, such as the name, is contained\
  \ within the metadata of the NFT, which can be looked up on Etherscan.\n\nTransactions\
  \ can be encoded via payload for a snapshot vote, therefore, transactions do not\
  \ have to be approved manually.\n\nFor further details on the specification, see:\
  \ Part II. The OtoCo Ethereum smart contracts - OtoCo Documentation (gitbook.io).\n\
