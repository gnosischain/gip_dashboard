title: Set up a legal entity controlled and owned by the DAO?
body: "##  **Simple Summary**\n\nThis is a proposal to set up a legal entity (in the\
  \ form of an LLC) owned by a Gnosis DAO wallet that enables the GnosisDAO to interact\
  \ with business partners with an incorporated entity.\n\n##  **Abstract**\n\nThis\
  \ new legal entity:  \n● Can enter into contractual arrangements on behalf of the\
  \ GnosisDAO  \n● Can make payments to different service providers that are undertaking\
  \  \nservices on behalf of the GnosisDAO  \n● Can hold assets/digital property such\
  \ as patents, copyrights or trademarks  \n● Is not owned by a physical person nor\
  \ an official representing the company,  \ninstead the legal entity is owned by\
  \ a smart contract address that is  \ncontrolled by the GnosisDAO\n\n##  **Motivation**\n\
  \nThe GnosisDAO is the decentralized collective steward of the Gnosis ecosystem.\
  \ It is participant managed, and does not have any director or manager. No single\
  \ party is in control. As the GnosisDAO exists entirely on-chain, it is not always\
  \ recognised as an entity with legal personality or limited liability. Some maintain\
  \ that an unincorporated DAO cannot enter into contracts with outside entities,\
  \ hold bank accounts or assets, or make cash payments. In order to be able to function\
  \ in the web2 world, we can create an associated legal entity owned by a smart contract\
  \ address that is controlled by the GnosisDAO.\n\n##  **Specification**\n\nTogether\
  \ with OtoCo (see OtoCo - Automated Company Assembly on Blockchain) it is possible\
  \ to create an LLC in Wyoming with a member that is neither a physical person nor\
  \ an official representing a company. Instead, the member can be a smart contract\
  \ address.  \nThis is achieved through a so-called Series LLC. A Series has a Master\
  \ and individual Series. Each Series is considered an LLC in its own right, with\
  \ its own name and its own Member(s) independent from the Members of the Master\
  \ LLC and other Series’ Members. Individual Series need a first Member. The first\
  \ Member of a Series LLC can be a smart contract address, using the OtoCo company\
  \ assembly smart contract.  \nEach Series LLC is represented by an NFT minted by\
  \ the OtoCo Master contract. Company information, such as the name, is contained\
  \ within the metadata of the NFT, which can be looked up on Etherscan.\n\nTransactions\
  \ can be encoded via payload for a snapshot vote, therefore, transactions do not\
  \ have to be approved manually.\n\nFor further details on the specification, see:\
  \ Part II. The OtoCo Ethereum smart contracts - OtoCo Documentation (gitbook.io).\n\
