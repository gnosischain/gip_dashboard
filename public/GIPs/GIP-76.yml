  \    \n    \n    GIP: 76\n    Set up a legal entity controlled and owned by the\
  \ DAO?\n    author: Monika \n    status: Draft\n    type: Meta\n    created: 2023-01-20\n\
  \    \n\n##  **Simple Summary**\n\nThis is a proposal to set up a legal entity (in\
  \ the form of an LLC) owned by a Gnosis DAO wallet that enables the GnosisDAO to\
  \ interact with business partners with an incorporated entity.\n\n##  **Abstract**\n\
  \nThis new legal entity:  \n● Can enter into contractual arrangements on behalf\
  \ of the GnosisDAO  \n● Can make payments to different service providers that are\
  \ undertaking  \nservices on behalf of the GnosisDAO  \n● Can hold assets/digital\
  \ property such as patents, copyrights or trademarks  \n● Is not owned by a physical\
  \ person nor an official representing the company,  \ninstead the legal entity is\
  \ owned by a smart contract address that is  \ncontrolled by the GnosisDAO\n\n##\
  \  **Motivation**\n\nThe GnosisDAO is the decentralized collective steward of the\
  \ Gnosis ecosystem. It is participant managed, and does not have any director or\
  \ manager. No single party is in control. As the GnosisDAO exists entirely on-chain,\
  \ it is not always recognised as an entity with legal personality or limited liability.\
  \ Some maintain that an unincorporated DAO cannot enter into contracts with outside\
  \ entities, hold bank accounts or assets, or make cash payments. In order to be\
  \ able to function in the web2 world, we can create an associated legal entity owned\
  \ by a smart contract address that is controlled by the GnosisDAO.\n\n##  **Specification**\n\
  \nTogether with OtoCo (see OtoCo - Automated Company Assembly on Blockchain) it\
  \ is possible to create an LLC in Wyoming with a member that is neither a physical\
  \ person nor an official representing a company. Instead, the member can be a smart\
  \ contract address.  \nThis is achieved through a so-called Series LLC. A Series\
  \ has a Master and individual Series. Each Series is considered an LLC in its own\
  \ right, with its own name and its own Member(s) independent from the Members of\
  \ the Master LLC and other Series’ Members. Individual Series need a first Member.\
  \ The first Member of a Series LLC can be a smart contract address, using the OtoCo\
  \ company assembly smart contract.  \nEach Series LLC is represented by an NFT minted\
  \ by the OtoCo Master contract. Company information, such as the name, is contained\
  \ within the metadata of the NFT, which can be looked up on Etherscan.\n\nTransactions\
  \ can be encoded via payload for a snapshot vote, therefore, transactions do not\
  \ have to be approved manually.\n\nFor further details on the specification, see:\
  \ Part II. The OtoCo Ethereum smart contracts - OtoCo Documentation ([gitbook.io](http://gitbook.io)).\n\

  \nIf DAOs can be recognized as LLCs in Wyoming, what would be the downside/upside\
  \ to that?\n\nReading time: 1 mins \U0001F551 Likes: 9 ❤\n\nPros of establishing\
  \ a DAO LLC in the United States:\n\n  1. **Legal recognition:** The organization\
  \ would be legally recognized by the government, which may increase trust and participation\
  \ from users.\n  2. **Liability protection:** Liability protection for the organization\
  \ and its members.\n  3. **Clarity:** Legal clarity for the organization and its\
  \ members, making it easier to navigate any legal issues that may arise.\n  4. **Compliance:**\
  \ Make it easier for the organization to comply with local regulations and laws,\
  \ which could be beneficial in the long term.\n\n\n\nCons of establishing a DAO\
  \ LLC in the United States:\n\n  1. **Decentralization:** Such a step would go against\
  \ the decentralized nature of DAOs and could limit the autonomy of the organization.\n\
  \  2. **Jurisdiction:** Establishing GnosisDAO LLC in the US would subject the organization\
  \ to the jurisdiction of US laws, which may not be ideal for a DAO as a global organization.\n\
  \  3. **Complexity:** Could be a complex process and may require specialized legal\
  \ expertise.\n  4. **Costs:** Likely be costly and may require ongoing expenses\
  \ for compliance and legal fees.\n  5. **Security classification:** This could raise\
  \ the issue of whether GNO/mGNO would be considered a security by the SEC. This\
  \ could have significant legal and financial implications for the organization and\
  \ its members. It could also limit the potential users and investors, who would\
  \ be restricted by the regulations.\n\n\n\n3 Likes\n\n[john_szczepaniak](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/john_szczepaniak)\

  \ January 21, 2023, 1:02pm  4\n\nIn my opinion, no one should start a DAO incorporated\
  \ in the US.\n\nAll these workarounds just add more complexity that can be avoided\
  \ if you just incorporate in e.g. Switzerland (See Safe Foundation and Ethereum\
  \ Foundation).\n\nIf you do this method in the US, even with all these legal gymnastics,\
  \ you will still be restricted by SEC and federal laws.\n\nFor example, if you setup\
  \ a DAO using this method, you likely still can’t even issue tokens because of the\

  \ 23, 2023, 10:36am  5\n\nGnosisDAO could think about to setup a foundation in Switzerland.\
  \ This would make more sense imo.\n\nWhy Switzerland:\n\n  * Switzerland has supportive\
  \ and crypto-friendly regulations\n  * Swiss government has established a clear\
  \ regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies\n  * Switzerland is a stable and secure\
  \ location for financial services companies\n  * Switzerland has a strong tradition\
  \ of banking secrecy, which can provide a level of privacy and security for the\
  \ foundation’s operations.\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is also there:\n\nThe\
  \ Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization that was also established in\
  \ Switzerland, specifically in the canton of Zug, which is known as the “Crypto\
  \ Valley” due to the presence of many blockchain and cryptocurrency companies in\
  \ the region. The foundation was established to support the development and adoption\
  \ of the Ethereum blockchain and its associated technologies. The Ethereum Foundation\
  \ is responsible for managing the Ethereum project’s assets, funding development\
  \ and research, and promoting the use of the Ethereum technology. The foundation\
  \ works closely with the Ethereum community to ensure the continued development\
  \ of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n1 Like\n\n[monika](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/monika)\
  \ January 23, 2023, 3:11pm  6\n\nThank you for your feedback on this important discussion.\
  \ One key clarification: The intention is not to incorporate the DAO as a US LLC\
  \ or to establish a form of “legal wrapper” for the DAO. Instead, the purpose behind\
  \ this proposal is to incorporate a subsidiary entity that is wholly owned/controlled\
  \ by the DAO, and has separate personality to enter into legally binding obligations\
  \ with third parties. The role of the LLC will be to perform certain defined activities,\
  \ as approved by the DAO and delegated to the LLC from time to time. One typical\
  \ example could be entering into legal agreements with service providers. The issuance\
  \ of tokens is a complex legal issue in many jurisdictions, and we do not envisage\
  \ that the LLC would be used for this purpose. The Otoco protocol enables a fast\
  \ and cost-efficient way to establish an LLC that is owned by a DAO controlled address,\
  \ and has relatively limited ongoing maintenance requirements compared to other\
  \ structures used by DAOs across different jurisdictions.\n\n[tomiwa1a](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/tomiwa1a)\
  \ January 23, 2023, 6:54pm  7\n\nA distinction without a difference, I still wouldn’t\
  \ recommend doing it in Wyoming.\n\nAlso from my understanding, it can’t be turtles\
  \ all the way down. At some point, ownership has to be tied to a a corporation or\
  \ an individual.\n\nIf the DAO tries to say that actually the LLC is owned by a\
  \ smart contract, the legal authorities will say, who are the signers for this smart\
  \ contract?\n\nI’m not a lawyer btw, but from what I know about governments they\
  \ usually require that no matter what form is taken someone can be held responsible.\n\
  \nI recommend just doing what the Ethereum Foundation has done and then tweaking\
  \ to suit Gnosis’ needs as necessary. Ethereum Foundation is the best example of\
  \ a DAO in the blockchain space. It makes sense to follow their example.\n\nMihail\

  \ January 24, 2023, 6:31pm  12\n\nHi mrtdlgc, I appreciate your concern here. Establishing\
  \ a legal entity owned by the DAO would not necessarily compromise on decentralization\
  \ since any activity that the entity engages in will ultimately be subject to the\
  \ DAO’s decision making process and governance framework, which remains decentralized\
  \ and autonomous. Accordingly, one could view this proposal as a way of preserving\
  \ the DAO’s autonomy and decentralized governance, but which enables execution through\
  \ an established legal entity.\n\n[monika](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/monika) January\
  \ 24, 2023, 6:32pm  13\n\nHi Blockchainbreakdown\n\nThese are valid points that\
  \ you raise, and obviously there are still many grey areas when it comes to the\
  \ issues affecting DAOs, as the legal / regulatory position continues to evolve.\n\
  \nThis is why it will be important to remain vigilant of developments in this area\
  \ and what activities the entity engages in from time to time, so that we can try\
  \ to mitigate any potential legal/regulatory risks going forwards.\n\nThe example\
  \ you refer to with Gemini and Genesis is quite different in my view, as those actions\
  \ relate to trading/lending products offered to customers by a centralised exchange,\
  \ which is definitely not the case here and the LLC should not be used for purposes\
  \ which would bring it within the scope of a regulated activity in the US.\n\nThe\
  \ main purpose of the LLC would be to enable the DAO to execute governance decisions\
  \ through a real world entity, that is able to establish legally binding and enforceable\
  \ obligations with third parties, who may require an established legal counterparty\
  \ for whatever reason. The purpose of this proposal is simply to incorporate the\
  \ entity, but any activity of that entity in the future would be subject to further\
  \ approval by the DAO. This way, the DAO has full control over the activities of\
  \ the LLC. So each activity of the LLC would go through a due diligence process,\
  \ further discussions among the community and a governance vote.\n\n[monika](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/monika)\
  \ January 24, 2023, 6:33pm  14\n\nHi DigitalConsultants The idea for proposing to\
  \ set up an entity arose from the specific limitations the DAO faces today, namely\
  \ entering into agreements with third parties who require a legally established\
  \ counterparty.\n\n[refri](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/refri) January 24, 2023, 7:11pm\

  \ it should be used for. Otherwise I also would prefer a swiss based foundation,\
  \ but ofc there might be drawbacks like higher costs.\n\n1 Like\n\n[Majico](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Majico)\
  \ January 25, 2023, 2:23pm  16\n\nHI! I perfectly understand the necessity to sign\
  \ a contract IRW, hold bank accounts or assets, or make cash payments.  \nThe main\
  \ problem that I see with GNOSISDAO owning a DAO LLC in the United States, is that\
  \ the DAO LLC must comply with the USA regulation. I understand that technically\
  \ the company will be owned by a smart contract, but in reality the owners will\
  \ be the GNO holders. So, in this way, GNO holders will be part of that “SubDAO”,\
  \ Is that correct? All parties should comply with USA regulation. Is that possible?\
  \  \nAnother point to analyse is the possibility that GNO would be considered a\
  \ security by the SEC, despite the fact that GNOSISDAO is not going to incorporate\
  \ as an American LLC.  \nRegarding taxes, OtoCo doc mentions that “Unless a multi-member\
  \ LLC has no revenue or expenses/credits to claim, a Form 1065 will need to be filed\
  \ with the IRS and each member will be required to fill out and attach a Schedule\
  \ K-1. This does not mean you are liable to pay taxes, it is just a reporting requirement”.\
  \ A report is an obligation that should be complied with.  \nIn some cases, multi-member\
  \ LLCs may be required to file a Form 8804 and 8805. Does it apply to GNO holders?\
  \  \nNote: non-resident members of the LLC are still supposed to submit a personal\
  \ 1040-NR for any income sourced from the U.S. and would need an ITIN”. How do you\
  \ plan to comply with this regulation?\n\n2 Likes\n\n[Silk](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/Silk)\
  \ January 25, 2023, 11:01pm  18\n\nIf you want to anchor the GnosisDAO in a US jurisdiction,\
  \ so that it may be considered a US person (including for sanction compliance, tax\
  \ payments of income etc), then this may be a solution. If this is not the case,\
  \ passing this proposal may undo GnosisDAO painstaking daofication, in which Otoco\
  \ was considered as a possible avenue and not chosen. Even if this is via a “subDAO”,\
  \ I think the risk is rather large for GnosisDAO to be drawn into the US facing\
  \ an increasingly hostile regulatory environment, especially in relation to sanctions.\
  \ Right now, I see not much clarity as to the legal distinctions in wrapping a DAO\
  \ and setting up an “assisting” subDAOs, if the DAO is the one initiating the LLC.\
  \ If a specific team wishes to have a US LLC, I would suggest for GnosisDAO to spin\
  \ the team off first and the team then deciding themselves to set up this entity\
  \ - so that there is a clear separation between the unincorporated GnosisDAO and\
  \ that team’s LLC. In my opinion, you will not create the level of separation necessariy\
  \ having the DAO initiate the Otoco LLC. The risks are high. If GnosisDAO hopes\
  \ to have a jurisdiction anchor, I believe there are better options that are less\
  \ prejudicial and may allow for greater long term neutrality of the GnosisDAO.\n\
