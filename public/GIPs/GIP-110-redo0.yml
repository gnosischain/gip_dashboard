title: Should the Gnosis DAO create and fund a Gnosis Pay rewards program with 10k
  GNO?
body: "## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to create a cashback program for Gnosis Pay,\
  \ benefiting GNO holders. The program will feature five tiers of cashback rewards,\
  \ ranging from 1% to 4% based on the amount of GNO deposited in Gnosis Pay. An extra\
  \ 1% (1pp) will be awarded to Gnosis Pay OG NFT holders. Rewards will be airdropped\
  \ weekly to users ~7 days after their transactions, calculated based on the minimum\
  \ GNO balance held during the week the payment was made. The rewards, measured in\
  \ the currency of the payment, will be distributed in GNO using the Gnosis Chain\
  \ GNO/USD, EUR/USD or GBP/USD Chainlink (or Chronicle for GBP) price feed at the\
  \ time of distribution of the reward. A maximum of EUR 20,000, USD 22,000, or GBP\
  \ 18,000 will be eligible to accrue rewards per month for every user. \n\n## Rationale\n\
  \nAfter last year's outstanding growth, Gnosis Chain has stagnated, mainly due to\
  \ the substantial incentives offered by alternative L1s and L2s. However, many of\
  \ the users and capital in these other chains are likely to leave once the incentives\
  \ end. Gnosis aims to create sticky users through a suite of products, with Gnosis\
  \ Pay being the first. After months of improvements, Gnosis Pay is now ready for\
  \ mass adoption. This cashback program is strategically designed to bootstrap user\
  \ engagement without significant costs to the DAO. Users participating in the program\
  \ must have GNO in their Gnosis Pay Safe wallet, incurring an opportunity cost by\
  \ not staking their GNO. Thus, since GNO held in a Safe wallet will not be staked,\
  \ the additional cost to the DAO would be minimal compared to the benefits.\n\n\n\
  ## Implementation\n\nUsers who hold GNO in the Gnosis Pay Safe will be eligible\
  \ for cashback rewards on eligible Gnosis Pay Card transactions according to the\
  \ following tiers:\n\n* ≥0.1 GNO: 1%\n* ≥1 GNO: 2%\n* ≥10 GNO: 3%\n* ≥100 GNO: 4%\n\
  \nThe cashback percentage scales continuously within each tier (e.g., holding 5.5\
  \ GNO earns 2.5% cashback). Beyond 100 GNO, the cashback percentage does not increase\
  \ any further. Additionally, Gnosis Pay OG NFT holders who qualify for the airdrop\
  \ (with at least 0.1 GNO deposited) will receive an extra 1% cashback. For instance,\
  \ a user holding 5.5 GNO and the OG NFT would receive 3.5% cashback. This feature\
  \ will add value to future NFT campaigns by Gnosis Pay (e.g., referral programs).\n\
  \nA maximum of EUR 20,000, USD 22,000, or GBP 18,000 will be eligible to accrue\
  \ rewards per month for every user. \n\nThe program will be administered and managed\
  \ by Karpatkey, responsible for tracking, determining, and distributing the rewards,\
  \ as well as reporting the results. The reward calculation code will be open source.\
  \ We will also provide an endpoint for those that want to feature the rewards in\
  \ their UIs. \n\nRewards will be distributed weekly, 5-12 days after the user made\
  \ the payment, based on the lowest amount of GNO tokens held in their Gnosis Pay\
  \ Safe during the week the payment was made. It is this amount of GNO held prior\
  \ to the card payment that will be relevant in calculating the cashback. For example,\
  \ having 1 GNO in the Gnosis Pay Safe and making a payment in the same week would\
  \ yield 2% cashback. However, topping up GNO to the Gnosis Pay Safe after a payment\
  \ does not change the cashback applicable to that payment. Eligible “payments” do\
  \ not include ATM withdrawals, which will not count towards card payments for the\
  \ purposes of this program. By participating in the program (transferring GNO to\
  \ the Gnosis Pay Safe), users agree that Gnosis Pay will share transaction details\
  \ related to ATM withdrawals with karpatkey. Transactions similar to this one on\
  \ essence (for example, topping up bank accounts with the card) will also not be\
  \ eligible, and this information will also be shared. However, personal information\
  \ will not be shared. The program will run until the budget runs off, or until the\
  \ DAO votes to terminate it or replace it. Cashback received from payments there\
  \ were refunded will tracked and until the users has a \"positive balance\" of accrued\
  \ rewards, no further payments will be made.\n\nShall this proposal passes, a trial\
  \ period will commence on August 19th, which will run for a week and will not accrue\
  \ any rewards. Then, the actual program will commence on August 26th.\n\nThe GNO\
  \ Cashback Program is sponsored by GnosisDAO, offered and administered by the Gnosis\
  \ DAO Operational Foundation, and operated by karpatkey in accordance with its mandate\
  \ from the Sponsor."
