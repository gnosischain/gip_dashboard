title: Should GnosisDAO pass a Grant Proposal to partner with Erigon?
body: Gnosis has been a long-term supporter of Erigonâ€™s development believing in the
  significance of improving L1 clients. Every improvement on L1 is an upside for everyone
  operating on top. Given the importance of strong L1 clients for Gnosis Chain and
  the unique value proposition of Erigon, the Erigon team should be supported with
  a significant grant of 2m DAI upfront and 24k GNO vested over 3 years allowing us
  to focus on Gnosis Chain.
