title: Should GnosisDAO support an annual renewal for Blockscout SLA and hosting services
  - October 2024 - October 2025?
body: "### Executive Summary\nBlockscout continues to be an integral part of the Gnosis\
  \ ecosystem, providing critical blockchain explorer services for both the Gnosis\
  \ mainnet and Chiado testnet. The open-source explorer has not only attracted and\
  \ retained users but has also become an indispensable tool for Gnosis developers.\
  \ We propose to continue our partnership, offering enhanced services and cutting-edge\
  \ features to further elevate the Gnosis user experience.\n\n### Demonstrated Value\n\
  \nOver the previous year (since our last update in [GIP 89](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-89-should-gnosisdao-support-an-annual-renewal-for-blockscout-sla-and-hosting-services/7269)),\
  \ Blockscout has delivered significant value and seen steady usage by the community.\
  \ The high-level numbers included here come from Mixpanel and directly from the\
  \ [Gnosis Blockscout instance](https://gnosis.blockscout.com/) covering stats from\
  \ September 1, 2023 through September 1, 2024 :\n\n Robust User Base:\n  * Monthly\
  \ active users increased from 11.2K in September 2023 to 28.4K in August 2024. High\
  \ traffic months included December 2023 with 45,069 MAU and June 2024 with 41,113\
  \ MAU.\n  * 115K average monthly page views over the previous year\n\nDeveloper\
  \ Support: \n* 42K verified contracts (all time)\n\nUser Engagement: \n* ~4.2K signups\
  \ to myAccount (since Oct 1, 2023)\n\n### Features and Improvements\n\nOver the\
  \ past year, we've implemented major features through standalone upgrades and significant\
  \ backend (V6+) and frontend improvements (v1.2+) including:\n\n* User Operations\
  \ Support - https://gnosis.blockscout.com/ops\n* Human-readable transactions\n*\
  \ Public tagging and tags submission\n* Name Service support\n* API and CSV export\
  \ improvements\n* SolidityScan security scores\n* DAppscout improvements including\
  \ star rating, DeFi menu and tooling, additional sorting features and more.\n\n\
  ### Roadmap for the upcoming year\n\n* Advanced filtering and sorting options\n\
  * Account Abstraction improvements\n* NFT explorer enhancements\n* Additional DeFi\
  \ integrations\n* Statistics and Analytics improvements (additional views, ability\
  \ to zoom)\n* Multichain search\n* User engagement and retention mechanisms\n\n\
  ### Bridged Transactions\n\nIn addition to the roadmap items above, we will create\
  \ a custom view for xDai bridge transactions providing similar functionality to\
  \ the current Bridged Deposit Transactions view in Gnosisscan (https://gnosisscan.io/txnbridge).\
  \ This view provides insights into xDai origination and allows for better tracking\
  \ and transparency.\n\n### Our Commitment\n\nGnosis is one of the original Blockscout\
  \ instances and will continue to receive priority updates, services and new features\
  \ as they are developed. Blockscout will continue to provide superior service for\
  \ the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\n1. Maintain and host Blockscout instances for Gnosis\
  \ Chain and Chiado testnet.\n2. Provide premium feature updates.\n3. Offer an SLA\
  \ that prioritizes maximum uptime, speed, and db optimizations.\n4. Deliver dedicated\
  \ support via Discord.\n\n### Timeline and Financial Proposition\n\nWe propose a\
  \ renewal of our 12-month engagement backdated to begin on 1 October 2024 and continuing\
  \ through 1 October 2025. Over the past year we have optimized our hosting operations\
  \ and on-premise infrastructure and are pleased to offer a 20% discount on our hosting\
  \ services for 2024-25.\n\n* Gnosis Chain Mainnet and archive node: $6,400/month\
  \ (was $8000 per month) for a total 12 month cost of $76,800\n* Chiado Testnet and\
  \ archive node: $3,200/month (was $4,000/month) for a total 12 month cost of $38,400\n\
  \n**Total Investment:** $115,200\n\n*This represents a $28,800 per year reduction\
  \ from our 2023 pricing, reflecting our commitment to value and support for the\
  \ Gnosis ecosystem.*\n\nAmount is requested up front for the year. Payment can be\
  \ made to Blockscout’s SAFE 0xAddress on Ethereum mainnet (0x242ba6d68FfEb4a098B591B32d370F973FF882B7)\
  \ with USDC or USDT.\n\n### Ongoing Support & Continued Growth\n\nBlockscout has\
  \ a proven track record of providing high-quality, reliable and affordable explorer\
  \ services. We’ve worked hard over the past year to optimize our offerings and close\
  \ the gap between features provided by closed source explorers and our open-source\
  \ explorer. We’ve provided resilience and redundancy over the past year during numerous\
  \ Gnosisscan outages. Above and beyond our parity with other scanners, we are dedicated\
  \ to developing new and innovative features to support Gnosis as a standalone ecosystem\
  \ as well as its role in the multichain future.\n\nBy renewing our partnership,\
  \ you're not just getting a blockchain explorer – you're investing in the continued\
  \ growth and success of the Gnosis ecosystem. Let's continue building the future\
  \ of blockchain exploration together!"
