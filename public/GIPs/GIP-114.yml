  \ (V6+) and frontend improvements (v1.2+) including:\n\n  * User Operations Support\
  \ - [User operations on Gnosis chain - Gnosis chain explorer | Blockscout](https://gnosis.blockscout.com/ops)\n\

  \ and sorting options\n  * Account Abstraction improvements\n  * NFT explorer enhancements\n\
  \  * Additional DeFi integrations\n  * Statistics and Analytics improvements (additional\
  \ views, ability to zoom)\n  * Multichain search\n  * User engagement and retention\
  \ mechanisms\n\n\n\n### Bridged Transactions\n\nIn addition to the roadmap items\
  \ above, we will create a custom view for xDai bridge transactions providing similar\
  \ functionality to the current Bridged Deposit Transactions view in Gnosisscan (<https://gnosisscan.io/txnbridge>).\
  \ This view provides insights into xDai origination and allows for better tracking\
  \ and transparency.\n\n### Our Commitment\n\nGnosis is one of the original Blockscout\
  \ instances and will continue to receive priority updates, services and new features\
  \ as they are developed. Blockscout will continue to provide superior service for\
  \ the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\n  1. Maintain and host Blockscout instances for Gnosis\
  \ Chain and Chiado testnet.\n  2. Provide premium feature updates.\n  3. Offer an\
  \ SLA that prioritizes maximum uptime, speed, and db optimizations.\n  4. Deliver\
  \ dedicated support via Discord.\n\n\n\n### Timeline and Financial Proposition\n\
  \nWe propose a renewal of our 12-month engagement backdated to begin on 1 October\
  \ 2024 and continuing through 1 October 2025. Over the past year we have optimized\
  \ our hosting operations and on-premise infrastructure and are pleased to offer\
  \ a 20% discount on our hosting services for 2024-25.\n\n  * Gnosis Chain Mainnet\
  \ and archive node: $6,400/month (was $8000 per month) for a total 12 month cost\
  \ of $76,800\n  * Chiado Testnet and archive node: $3,200/month (was $4,000/month)\
  \ for a total 12 month cost of $38,400\n\n\n\n**Total Investment:** $115,200\n\n\
  _This represents a $28,800 per year reduction from our 2023 pricing, reflecting\
  \ our commitment to value and support for the Gnosis ecosystem._\n\nAmount is requested\
  \ up front for the year. Payment can be made to Blockscout’s SAFE 0xAddress on Ethereum\
  \ mainnet (0x242ba6d68FfEb4a098B591B32d370F973FF882B7) with USDC or USDT.\n\n###\
  \ Ongoing Support & Continued Growth\n\nBlockscout has a proven track record of\
  \ providing high-quality, reliable and affordable explorer services. We’ve worked\
  \ hard over the past year to optimize our offerings and close the gap between features\
  \ provided by closed source explorers and our open-source explorer. We’ve provided\
  \ resilience and redundancy over the past year during numerous Gnosisscan outages.\
  \ Above and beyond our parity with other scanners, we are dedicated to developing\
  \ new and innovative features to support Gnosis as a standalone ecosystem as well\
  \ as its role in the multichain future.\n\nBy renewing our partnership, you’re not\
  \ just getting a blockchain explorer – you’re investing in the continued growth\
  \ and success of the Gnosis ecosystem. Let’s continue building the future of blockchain\
  \ exploration together!\n\n## Gnosis Snapshot\n\n_Phase 2 Proposals: Please ignore\
