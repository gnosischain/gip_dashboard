title: Should Gnosis DAO renew the Delegate Program?
body: "**Author**: @Kene_StableLab\nGIP: 137\nstatus: phase 2\ntype: Funding\n## **Simple\
  \ Summary**\nThis proposal makes the case for renewing the Gnosis DAO Delegate Program\
  \ for 6 months. The program lays out the case for delegating 5000 GNO to 10 eligible\
  \ delegates to ensure that a quorum is met on all DAO proposals.\nStableLab will\
  \ administer the program for $20,000 for the entire program duration of six months.\
  \ StableLab would also require forum administrator access to track participation\
  \ metrics.\nTotal program cost: **$20,000** for 6 months. \n\n## **Motivation**\n\
  **Six-Month Trial Period Overview**\nAfter the delegations to the 10 selected delegates\
  \ were made, the Gnosis DAO’s issue of failing to reach quorum on proposals became\
  \ a non-issue. In contrast, delegate participation has gradually increased over\
  \ time. GnosisDAO also saw several delegate-led proposals and biweekly governance\
  \ calls, which have become an opportunity for clarity on the direction of the Gnosis\
  \ DAO.\nDue to issues with the Gnosis DAO Snapshot Subspace, the delegate program\
  \ could not start on the date it was voted into governance; it started on April\
  \ 17th instead, after delegations were made to 10 selected delegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\
  **Total Delegates**\n10\n**Total GIPs Tracked**\n9 (GIP-99, GIP-108, GIP-126, GIP-128,\
  \ GIP-133, GIP-130, GIP-135, GIP-134 and GIP-132)\n**Overall Voting Rate**\n**82%**\n\
  **Overall Communication Rate**\n**76%**\n## **Performance Summary**\n### **High\
  \ Performers (100% Voting Rate)**\n-   ACI, Areta, mrtdlgc, Viszla, Staworth\n###\
  \ **Perfect Communication (100% Comm Rate)**\n-   Areta, mrtdlgc, Viszla, Staworth,\
  \ Gardens (paul2)\n    \n### **Needs Improvement (<80% Voting Rate)**\n-   Gnosis\
  \ Guild (44%)    \n-   Stake Capital (60%)    \n-   Breadchain Cooperative (55%)\n\
  You can look at this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r_KiE_KJRJ3by2KNEIetN0ZsTiKOgicP8fj6VhPoH_Y/edit?usp=sharing)\
  \ for a detailed breakdown of each delegate.\nThe current trial run expires October\
  \ 17, 2025. Key achievements include:\n-   80% proposal quorum success rate    \
  \ \n-   Increased governance activity and higher quality discussions\n    \n   \
  \ \n\nFeedback from existing DAO stakeholders is as follows:\n\n-   Delegates need\
  \ compensation to justify time allocation\n    \n-   Need for objective, measurable\
  \ performance metrics\n    \n-   Desire for comprehensive tracking of all participation\
  \ types\n    \n\n## **Specification**\n\n### **GNO Delegation**\n\nSimilar to the\
  \ initial trial program, the DAO will be allocating a total delegation of **50,000\
  \ GNO** to all eligible nominees, who will be subjected to a Snapshot selection\
  \ process, after which the top-selected delegates will each receive a **5,000 GNO**\
  \ delegation that plays a key role in ensuring that the Gnosis DAO continues to\
  \ reach quorum on its proposals.\n\n### **Program Structure**\n\n**Delegate Track\
  \ (10 positions)**\n\n-   **Requirements**:\n    \n    -   Minimum 200 GNO voting\
  \ power (delegated or owned)\n        \n    -   80% minimum threshold for voting\
  \ and rationale communication\n        \n\n### **Selection Criteria**\n\nDelegates:\
  \ Top 10 delegates selected by Gnosis DAO Governance who meet requirements.\n\n\
  ### **Evaluation Criteria**\n\nAll participants are evaluated monthly on four equally\
  \ weighted metrics that determine their performance bonus:\n\n1.  **Voting Rate**:\
  \ Percentage of proposals voted on\n    \n2.  **Rationale Communication Rate**:\
  \ Percentage of votes with written rationales\n    \n3.  **Forum Participation Rate**:\
  \ Frequency and quality of forum contributions\n    \n4.  **Governance Call Attendance**:\
  \ Attendance at biweekly DAO calls\n    \n\n**Note**: Rationales now have a deadline\
  \ of being posted three days after the vote closes, to ensure timely communication\
  \ of rationales.\n\n\n### **Data Collection and Transparency**\n\n**Forum Administrator\
  \ Access**: Execution of this proposal requires granting StableLab forum administrator\
  \ access to enable tracking of forum participation rates and quality assessment\
  \ of forum contributions\n\n**Monthly Reporting**: StableLab will publish comprehensive\
  \ reports, including:\n\n-   Individual participant scores for each metric\n   \
  \ \n-   Bonus calculations with full transparency\n    \n-   Aggregate performance\
  \ statistics\n    \n\n### **Program Administration**\n\n**StableLab’s Responsibilities**:\n\
  \n-   Monitor all four performance metrics via the forum admin tools\n    \n-  \
  \ Calculate and process monthly payments with support by kpk\n    \n-   Publish\
  \ detailed monthly performance reports\n    \n-   Manage delegate communications\n\
  \    \n\n**StableLab Compensation**: $20,000 worth of GNO for 6 months, vesting\
  \ at the end of two quarters. \n\n### **Accountability Framework**\n\n**Monthly\
  \ Performance Reviews**:\n\n-   Individual scorecards for all four metrics are published\n\
  \    \n-   Clear documentation of bonus calculations\n    \n-   Comparison to the\
  \ previous month's performance\n    \n\n### **Budget Breakdown**\n\nStableLab Administration\
  \ cost - $20,000 worth of GNO for 6 months, vesting at the end of two quarters.\
  \ \n    \n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n-   Open forum nominations with clear requirements\n\
  \    \n-   Review and host a snapshot-weighted choice selection process based on\
  \ eligibility\n    \n-   Delegate 5,000 GNO each to selected delegates\n    \n-\
  \   New program begins with full metric tracking\n    \n-   Reports are published\
  \ on the 5th of each month\n    \n\n## **Success Metrics**\n\n-   **Quorum Maintenance**:\
  \ 100% of proposals meet quorum\n    \n-   **Participation Improvement**: Average\
  \ scores increase month-over-month\n    \n-   **Transparency**: All metrics are\
  \ publicly verifiable\n    \n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThis renewal creates a data-driven\
  \ governance framework with transparent, measurable performance metrics. The evaluation\
  \ system (voting rate, rationale communication rate, forum participation rate, and\
  \ governance call attendance) ensures comprehensive participation, while the forum\
  \ administrator access enables accurate tracking and reporting.\n\nThe program directly\
  \ addresses stakeholder feedback for ensuring a consistent quorum for Gnosis DAO\
  \ during this critical strategic period."
