title: 'Should Gnosis DAO support a reimbursement plan to the Hundred Finance Community
  in the following manner? '
body: 'On March 15th, 2022, the Gnosis Chain deployment of the Hundred Finance lending
  platform was exploited. This exploit drained liquidity across all of Hundred Financeâ€™s
  Gnosis Chain markets, resulting in a loss of the equivalent of around $6.4m USD
  in user funds (calculated using asset prices at the time of the attack).


  The Hundred Finance team seeks to put forward this new version of a previously raised
  proposal that similarly seeks to respond to the exploit on behalf of its affected
  users by implementing a reimbursement plan in which they and the Gnosis DAO work
  together to make whole those who have been adversely impacted.


  Please reference the entire proposal by clicking the discussion link below. '
