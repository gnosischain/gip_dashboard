title: 1INCH liquidity
body: "##  Simple Summary\n\nThis is a continuation of [F117’s post](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-partner-with-1inch-to-increase-gno-1inch-liquidity/3284).\
  \  \nAs part of the growth of GnosisDAO’s strategic partnerships, increasing the\
  \ liquidity of pairs with our GNO token and our partners’ is in our DAO’s best interest.\
  \ This creates synergy between us and our partners, strengthening both our token\
  \ and theirs in terms of potential price increase and reduced volatility.\n\n##\
  \  Abstract\n\nWe would partner with 1inch and create a GNO:1inch liquidity pool\
  \ that could be deposited on 1Inch protocol, running on Gnosis Chain. In this particular\
  \ case, there’s the positive side effect that increasing overall liquidity in the\
  \ Gnosis Chain also makes it more appealing for investors in the DeFi ecosystem\
  \ as both tokens would support each other’s prices, creating long term economic\
  \ alignment.\n\n##  Motivation\n\n1inch is one of the most popular DEX Aggregators\
  \ in the DeFi ecosystem, and it lacks liquidity of the GNO:1INCH pair. We believe\
  \ that creating this liquidity pool will be beneficial for both tokens, contributing\
  \ to their long term price stability and providing users with sufficient liquid\
  \ funds to exchange their tokens.\n\n##  Specification\n\nWe’d work jointly with\
  \ the 1inch team to create the liquidity pool in several batches to minimize slippage,\
  \ aiming for 0.1%, to prevent arbitration that would result in loss of funds for\
  \ 1inch and GnosisDAO.\n\n##  Rationale\n\nThe iterative pool creation process is\
  \ a best practice which results in slippage minimization and reduced arbitrage opportunities\
  \ which lead to loss of funds from both parties, causing an evitable unwanted side\
  \ effect.  \nThe 1inch team will lead the process, since the pool will most likely\
  \ be created in their platform.\n\n[Karpatkey: 2022 Year in Review for Gnosis](http://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431)\n"
