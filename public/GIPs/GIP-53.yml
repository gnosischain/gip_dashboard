title: Should GnosisDAO sponsor Necromorfoâ€™s Cryptorock Tour 2022?
body: 'The Cryptorock Tour proposal aims to execute a web3 onboarding tour in 14 different
  cities in Mexico with presentations from the band [Necromorfo](https://instagram.com/necro_morfo)
  supported by projects like [Rockoboy](https://www.instagram.com/rockoboyoff/), [Pajaros
  Vampiro](https://www.instagram.com/pajarosvampiro/) and [The Froys](https://www.instagram.com/thefroysmx/),
  as well as local bands from each city.


  The Gnosis Chain ecosystem will provide the infrastructure for the onboardings,
  using tools such as:

  * Chainlist.org

  * Tip Party (by Moonshot Collective)

  * POAP

  * Honeyswap

  * Giveth

  * Agave

  * [Suarmi](https://suarmi.com) and [Connext](https://bridge.connext.network) bridges


  A deep insight into the planning and logistics can be found in the [Gnosis discussion
  forum](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-53-should-gnosisdao-sponsor-necromorfos-cryptorock-tour-2022/5314),
  as well as supporting media and documents.


  * GnosisDAO will provide **$15,000.00 xDAI** to Necromorfo, in exchange for onboardings,
  live shows and brand placement in 14 cities across Mexico.

  * The tour aims to reach at least 1,200 show attendees, of which our goal is to
  onboard a 10% to Gnosis Chain.

  * A follow-up with local communities in the next months after the tour will encourage
  further local onboardings using Gnosis Chain.

  * The funds provided by GnosisDAO will be transparent at all moment. A detailed,
  updated pre-production expense report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vea48si-0ueNRanP6YlQjOxXuXs4B4e3qydpENm0K4Q/edit?usp=sharing).

  * Necromorfo will include a feature documentary film executive-produced by GnosisDAO
  around the tour in their deliveries.'
